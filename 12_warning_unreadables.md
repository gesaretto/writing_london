#Unreadables

Drawing from Tim's and Emily's insightful remarks on the oscillation of character and genre in _A warning for fair women_, I would like to further investigate the problem of readability in the play. The  author seems to participate in a collective difficulty in interpreting social and psychological indicators: these are polysemous and shifting, and their presentation puzzles spectators both off and on stage. Like the neighbors that witness the first dialogue between Anne and Browne, at the footsteps of her _doore_, we are shown a series of interactions where individual motives and responsibilities remain uncertain, concealed by ambivalent social cues: in this case, was the man's behavior different from that of other "arrand-making Gallants," essentially harmless "good men" in the eyes of the woman? Anne reads the courtly language of her suitor as if she was in a comedy: she decides that Browne's insistence is compatible with his theatrical "type" - tiresome, perhaps, but still tolerable in its adherence to a shared convention. Nevertheless, after a couple of comedic "stumbles," immediately mended by the intervention of _Tragedie_, Browne's identity publicly shifts. It is, then, Anne's own conduct that becomes especially unreadable: tricked by her family and friends (Anne Drewry "misreads" the destiny written in her palm), forced by the circumstances and, above all, worried about her two sons, she has plenty of good reasons to lie about her involvement in the crime - so much that we start sincerely doubting it. In an exemplarily problematic scene, the _Minister_ insists on her innocence, and on the virtue of Christian mercy, only to be accused of injustice and lechery by _Master Iames_. As it adheres to the public perception of facts, this "home-borne Tragedy" - devoid of "revenge" - purposely denies a consistently readable identity to its characters and to itself.

#Notes on the _Famous Voyage_

##Tentative structure

- The denial; discarding what is considered unworthy.

- Ejection: the body gets rid of its shit; the city get rids of its garbage; the community of the city gets rid of its undesirable elements.

- Anxiety of _mixture_: abjection. Being unable of distinguishing between the elements that constitute an organism. _Merd-urinous_. Alcides.

    - Abjection? Broken boundaries. Flood.
    
- The _atoms_. Everything returns back to you.

- Conclusion: the poem eventually incorporated those epic moments that it had refused at the very beginning.

##Close readings and the text

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  

First of all, I notice the slippage between _poet_ and _character_, _agens_ and _auctor_. Regardles of whom the two characters mentioned on line 5 are, the crucial notion of this first few lines is that, whereas the poets of antiquity were simply telling these stories, Jonson's contemporaries were actually _living_ them.

More ideas from this passage: the negation of the opening is of course the most prominent feature; this is a false _apophasis_ or _occupatio_, where the denied subject of the discourse is eventually _actually_ denied. There is not enough material to know anything about these stories, if we are not acquainted with their matter: it is simply a matter of naming, _en passant_.

On this note, it would be interesting to look at the function of _italics_ in this poem; was this typographical device a choice of the poet? Or an editorial intervention that we could impute to the printer? Also, how do these _italics_ work? Not only have we proper names of both mythical and historical - contemporary - figures; we have toponyms and place names. _Troyes_ and _hell_. Why is this equivalence set? Is this a feature that we could relate to our idea of London as an organism?

Another feature that we could consider: the rhyme of tell and helll; the very enjambement of "tell / Of"; the _falsity_ attributed to these ancient stories.

I guess that this is the central point of the passage: these stories were false, and they were all the same. We have the _power_ to _act_ (_potentia_, _actus_); what will be told now is not false, will not abuse the readers' faith (the poet is including himself among them, in the "our" of l. 4 and the "We" of l. 5); what will be told is not part of those _bolder fables_.

What do we make of the synecdoche of the first verse? _Greece_ is the entirety of the Greek and classical tradition (although here Jonson is attentively avoiding any specific reference to Latin narratives - if we exclude, of course, the _Latine Muse_ of l. 3).

How does the _realism_ that is opposed to the chivalric, fantastic _just knights_ of l. 4 become the _mannerism_ of this entire work?

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  

The discourse becomes here explicitly hellish, of course: the attention shifts from the _Greece_ of l. 1 to the four __rivers__ (__!!!__) that run through hell. This fluvial convergence creates, as a consequence, the _Fleet_: it is a reference to its superiority. But how is this superiority produced?At this moment we simply have an __equivalence__: the three qualities indicated as peculiarities for the four hellish rivers are all present in the Fleet; the Fleet is the sum of the four hellish rivers - and _nothing more_. What do we make of the final two lines? The _save_ is perhaps the introduction of a contradiction: _except for_, _except that_. So that this quality of "confusion" is - _potentially_ - a detraction from the total sum of the _Fleet_'s characteristics. The Fleet is equal to the sum of the four previous rivers, minus their _distinction_. The _Fleet_, like this _poem_, is a mess.

What is this _distinction_? Is this simply a matter of clarity of articulation? I think that this very simple idea could be the true indicator of an _ecological_ concern: the three negative elements are right now so profoundly intermixed with the essence of the river, that it would be truly impossible to separate them again. _Confusion_ is a word that we should probably look up.

Notice the contrast between __here__ and __there__, and between __our__ and __they__. These two worlds are entirely apart - there is no fusion between them.

Or is there? Remember your Dante - the rivers of hell actually come from earth (since hell, like purgatory, is on earth). Is there a suggestion about their earthly origin here as well?

Again, the contrast is between _potentia_ and _actus_, or, better still, between fiction and reality - what is __boasted__ and what is __prov'd__.

_Filth_, _stench_, and _noyse_, are interesting choices. The latter two clearly refer to specific senses (smell and hearing); what do we make of _filth_? Is it a visual quality? A tactile quality? Or is it simply the general cause of the other two consequences?

Perhaps the _filth_ is the _confusion_ of _stench_ and _noyse_ (but probably __not__).

> Their werry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> And, for the cryes of _Ghosts_, women, and men  
> Laden with plague-sores, and their sinnes, were heard,  
> Lash'd by their consciences, to die, affeard.  


The first line is slightly puzzling: is this again simply an equivalence? Why do these two phrases sound like a contrast - or a parallel - when they are not? Notice, however, that from line 2 onwards the poem is actually establishing a numerical superiority of this _adventure_ (the English adventure) to the classical one: on the boat there are _two_ ferrymen, instead of the single _Charon_ - and they are _more_ horride; one _Cerberus_ is replaced by a coast of dogs (better still - this is a strange rhetorical figure, between a synecdoche and a metaphor: we should look for it, but not now). The following line is even better: this is a pure _replacement_ of one item for another. There is __no need__ for the _Furies_, because there is actually a vast abundance of women whose value is highly superior than the one coming from Greece. This negation is the fundative trope of the entire poem, of course: it is the refusal that motivates an acceptance of the new, improved product. There is also an idea of _currency_ in the fact that _one_ scold would be worth _ten_ furies, as if we were talking about coins and banknotes.

I am still fascinated by that first line, which is also an instant of _negation_. Rhymes also seem to be doing an interesting work here - _none_ and _Charon_, _dogs_ and _frogs_, _ten_ and _men_. There seems to be a strong awareness of their purpose in this section.

Finally, the third line of this passage (13 in the poem): what do we make of this simple transaction, this simple equivalence? Are the arses _more_ than the _frogs_? How is this _croaking_ intensified by the fact of being a _fart_?

The attention to the bodily is already perceivable in the _plague-sores_ leading those _women_ and _men_ to death. That is also an interesting paradox. First of all, this is not an instance of _hyperbole_, or _extra-value_: we have a simple equivalence; our _Ghosts_ are the men and women that are dying every day from the plague. The poem gets closer to their skin and to their sins: it is not simply the _plague_, it is the _sores_ of the plague. The _passive voice_ is also fascinating here: this is something that our travellers experience passively; it is a quality suspendend in the air.

We find a sort of _ideological chasm_ in thsese two lines: __1__ and __4__ are physical (plague-sores, death); __2__ and __3__ are spiritual (sinnes, consciences). Is this the real novelty of this poem? The fact that it is dealing with the boundary between life and death, and not simply with the hereafter? Is it simply a hightened attention devoted to the physical (and, therefore, another example of _realism_)?

This moment is an anticipation of what will happen with __metempsychosis__. It is the introduction of a potentially threatening combination - fusion - between the material and the immaterial realms.

> Then let the former age, with this content her,  
> Shee brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer.  

The italics seems truly too subtle to be an editorial intervention; Jonson is clearly using it with the explicit purpose of marking the _exotic_ element in his narrative. It will be interesting to see how this trait is applied to objects that are __not__ drawn from a different context (streets of London, cities in the world).

The _former_ age is female.

The contrast is again set between the narrating voices of the past, who could be lying; who probably are lying; and the _adventurers_ of the present (those who hold the __power__ to __act__).

> __The Voyage It Selfe__

There is something comical about the obviousness of this title, and about the presumptuousness of the "It Selfe."

The comical value of this title lies within its stress upon the concreteness of the experience; the experience has happened, and the poet will only focus on it. No, it is not this. What does "The Voyage It Selfe" mean? Why is it funny? (Because it is funny.) It is separating what is the voyage from what is not the voyage. It is a section, a boundary. It is limiting the perimeter of the actual experience from what was not part of the experience. Therefore, as a poetical mode, having left beyond the errors of the _past age_ and the allure of epic - or the wrong ways of epic, the poet is preparing the reader for a section that will be solely devoted to the actual truth of its content. If any move will be made from now on, it will be a move of persisten rejection. We have left everything that was dangerously foreign to the reality of this story beyond us; we have discarded it, refused it, rejected it. It is not true; it does not fit here. It is inferior and bad. We have gotten rid of it.

> I sing the brave adventure of two wights,  
> And pitty 'tis, I cannot call them knights:  

What is the relationship between this impossibility of _naming_ and the rejection of the initial section? Between the _just knights_ of Troy and this immediate attempt to transform these two _wights_ into _knights_? Why should the poet be doing this? He is trying a different mode now - the mode of realism and truth; the mode of urban spaces and history; no fiction nor romance here. But, immediately, we are confronted with this contradiction in his purpose - he should content himself with telling the simple story of these few merry travellers in the poorest neighborhoods of London; instead, he is trying to render them more noble than they are. To assimilate them to the discarded objects that have been thrown away.

The shit that you write is similar to the shit that you hate; the things you keep closest - the things that you produce, that you put together, that you craft - are similar to the things that you have tried to get rid of. You are your own shit.

> One was; and he, for brawne, and braine, right able  
> To have beene stiled of King _Arthurs_ table.  

Even worse! Immediately, the language of romance. This is, though, the evocation of an absent referent. This is something that the work can be compared to, that it is evoked by thinking about it, but not something present.

> The other was a squire, of faire degree;  
> But, in the action, greater man than hee:  

Again, contrast between action and fiction, with action preferred to fiction; although not satisfactorily here, since this consolation - or this simple true, only invests the poet _after_ he has tried to transform one of his heroes into the hero of a different genre, the hero of an impossible romance. Why is he comparing these stories to stories that are famously false, since his perspective is precisely to make the difference clear and accepted. In any case, this preference accorded to the __action__ is enough to reassure us about the location of the poem.

> Who gave, to take at his returne from _Hell_,  
> His three for one. Now, lordings, listen well.  

Here we have a return to the _economic discourse_ that has been introduced when value was first assessed numerically. "Three for one" is an exchange in value; it is a wager, a transfer; it is the ground on which you base your very _adventure_. Again, Jonson is asking us to buy what he is selling; he is asking us to invest in the _voyage_ in precisely the same way in which his hero did, so that we might be granted ourselves a _three for one_. This investment is paralleled with the line in which we listen - we have become __investors__ and adventurers precisely in the moment when we have started listening to the tale. We have to buy the product, once again.

__Questions to be asked other sources__: how close did BJ live to the Fleet that he is describing (i.e.: how much can he be really considered as part of the _we_ used in the poem)? Could we consider the publication of the _epigrammes_ as a commercial venture of sorts?

>  
> It was the day, what time the powerfull _Moone_  
> Makes the poore _Banck-side_ creature wet it' shoone,  
> In it' owne hall; when these (in worthy scorne  
> Of those, that put on moneyes, on returne  
> From _Venice_, _Paris_, or some in-land passage  
> Of sixe times to, and fro, without embassage,  
> Or him that backward went to _Berwicke_, or which  
> Did dance the famous Morrisse, unto _Norwich_)  
> At _Bread-streets_ Mermaid, having din'd, and merry,  
> Propos'd to goe to _Hol'borne_ in a wherry:  
> A harder tasque, then either his to Bristo',  
> Or his to _Antwerpe_. Therefore, once more, list ho'.  

Again, the idea of a commercial venture; insistence on its potential _risk_.

>  
> A _Docke_ there is, that called is _Avernus_,  
> Of some _Bride-well_, and may, in time, concerne us  
> All, that are readers: but, me thinkes 'tis od,  
> That all this while I have forgot some _god_,  
> Or _goddesse_ to invoke, to stuffe my verse;  
> And with both bombard-stile, and phrase, rehearse  
> The many perills of this _Port_, and how  
> Sans'helpe of _Sybil_, or a golden bough,  
> Or magick sacrifice, they past along!  
> _Alcides_, be thou succouring to my song.  

Please note that the epiteth __Alcides__ might be a specific reference to Heracles' __human mother__. In that case, Jonson would be lying to us, or to himself, or quoting a very dubious version of Heracles' story. Heracles is a __demi-god__, not a god.

> Thou hast seene _hell_ (some say) and know'st all nookes there,  
> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  
> Great _Club-fist_, though thy backe, and bones be sore,  
> Still, with thy former labours; yet, once more,  
> Act a brave worke, call it thy last adventry:  
> But hold my torch, while I describe the entry  
> To this dire passage. Say, thou stop thy nose:  
> 'Tis but light paines: Indeede this _Dock's_ no rose.  
>  
> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts due cluster,  
> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  
> Thorough her wombe they make their famous road,  
> Betweene two walls; where, on one side, to scar men,  
> Were seene your ugly _Centaures_, yee call Car-men,  
> _Gorgonian_ scolds, and _Harpyes_: on the other  
> Hung stench, diseases, and old filth, their mother,  
> With famine, wants, and sorrowes many a dosen,  
> The least of which was to the plague a cosen.  
> But they unfrighted passe, though many a privie  
> Spake to 'hem louder, then the oxe in _Livie_:  
> And many a sinke pour'd out her rage anenst 'hem;  
> But still their valour, and their vertue fenc't hem,  
> And, on they went, like _Castor_ brave, and _Pollux_:  
> Ploughing the mayne. When, see (the worst of all lucks)  
> They met the second Prodigie, would feare a  
> Man, that had never heard of a _Chimaera_.  

What the fuck do we do of this phenomenal _enjambement_?!

> One said, it was bold _Briareus_, or the beadle,  
> (Who hath the hundred hands when he doth meedle)  
> The other thought it _Hydra_, or the trock  
> Made of the trull, that cut her fathers lock:  

There is apparently a confusion - a mythological blindness here. Is it intentional?

> But, comming neere, they found it but a liter,  
> So huge, it seem'd, they could by no meanes quite her.  
> Backe cry'd their brace of _Charons_: they cry'd, no,  
> No going backe; on still you rogues, and row.  
> How hight the place? a voyce was heard, _Cocytus_.  
> Row close then slaves. Alas they will beshite us.  
> No matter, stinkards, row. What croaking sound  
> Is this we heare? of frogs? No, guts wind-bound,  
> Over your heads: Well, row. At this a loud  
> Crack did report it selfe, as if a cloud  
> Had burst with storme, and down fell, _ab excelsis_,  
> Poore _Mercury_, crying out on _Paracelsus_,  
> And all his followers, that had so abus'd him:  
> And, in so shitten sort, so long had us'd him:  

This is the same notion that we had encountered before: the re-using of culture; culture as an element of consumption. Culture eaten and shat.

> For (where he was the god of eloquence,  
> And subtlitie of mettalls) they dispense  
> His spirits, now, in pills, and eeke in potions,  
> Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions.  
> But many Moones there shall not wane (quoth hee)  

Notice that there are no italics for either __Moone__ or __god__ here. Why?

> (In the meane time, let 'hem imprison mee)  
> But I will speake (and know I shall be heard)  
> Touching this cause, where they will be affeard  
> To answere me. And sure, it was th'intent  
> Of the grave fart, late let in parliament,  
> Had it beene seconded, and not in fume  
> Vanish'd away: as you must all presume  
> Their _Mercury_ did now. But this, the stemme  
> Of the hulke touch'd, and, as by _Polypheme_  
> The slie _Ulysses_ stole in a sheepes-skin,  
> The well-greas'd wherry now had got betweene,  
> And bad her _fare-well sough_, unto the lurden:  
> Never did bottom more betray her burden;  
> The meate-boate of Beares colledge, _Paris-garden_,  
> Stunke not so ill; nor, when shee kist, _Kate Arden_.  
> Yet, one day in the yeere, for sweet 'tis voyc't  
> And that is when it is the Lord _Maiors_ foist.  
>  
> By this time they had reach'd the _Stygian_ poole,  
> By which the _Masters_ sweare, when, on the stoole  
> Of worship, they their nodding chinnes doe hit  
> Against their breasts. Here, sev'rall ghosts did flit  
> About the shore, of farts, but late departed,  
> White, black, blew, greene, and in more formes outstarted,  
> Then all those _Atomi_ ridiculous,  
> Whereof old _Democrite_, and _Hill Nicholas_,  
> One said, the other swore, the world consists.  

The _atoms_ are crucial. The notion of _atoms_ is the notion of a potential economy of physics - a potential economy of physics that allows for an inglobation of the immaterial into the material - farts are spirits; farts have atomic shadows which leave shit behind them. 

> These be the cause of those thicke frequent mists  
> Arising in that place, through which, who goes,  
> Must trie the un-used valour of a nose:  
> And that ours did. For yet, no nare was tainted,  

Some attention should be payed to the way in which the poet enters his world through the use of the first person plural.

> Nor thumbe, nor finger to the stop acquainted,  
> But open, and un-armed encounter'd all:  
> Whether it languishing stucke upon the wall,  
> Or were precipitated downe the jakes,  
> And, after, swom abroad in ample flakes,  
> Or, that it lay, heap'd like an usurers masse,  
> All was to them the same, they were to passe,  
> And so they did, from _Styx_, to _Acheron_:  
> The ever-boyling floud. Whose bankes upon  
> Your _Fleet_-lane _Furies_; and hot cookes doe dwell,  
> That, with still-scalding steemes, make the place _hell_.  
> The sinkes ran grease, and haire of meazled hogs,  
> The heads, houghs, entrailes, and the hides of dogs:  
> For, to say truth, what scullion is so nastie,  
> To put the skins, and offall in a pastie?  
> Cats there lay divers had beene flead, and rosted,  
> And, after mouldie growne, againe were tosted,  
> Then, selling not, a dish was tane to mince 'hem,  
> But still, it seem'd, the rankness did convince 'hem.  
> For, here they were throwne in with'the melted pewter,  
> Yet drown'd they not. They had five lives in future.  
> But 'mong'st these _Tiberts_, who do'you thinke there was?  
> Old _Bankes_ the juggler, our _Pythagoras_,  
> Grave tutor to the learned horse. Both wich,  
> Being, beyond sea, burned for one witch:  
> Their spirits transmigrated to a cat:  
> And now, above the poole, a face right fat  
> With great grey eyes, are lifted up, and mew'd;  
> Thrise did it spit: thrise div'd. At last, it view'd  
> Our brave _Heroes_ with a milder glare,  
> And, in a pittious tune, began. How dare  
> Your daintie nostrills (in so hot a season  
> When every clerke eats artichokes, and peason,  
> Laxative lettuce; and such windie meate)  
> Tempte such a passage? when each privies seate  
> Is fill'd with buttock? And the walls doe sweate  
> Urine, and plaisters? when the noise doth beate  
> Upon your eares, of discords so un-sweet?  

Please focus on this __negation__. Negation is a __moment__ in this progression; this negation of _modicum_, of _modus in rebus_.

> And out-cryes of the damned in the _Fleet_?  
> Cannot the _Plague_-bill keepe you backe? nor bells  
> Of loud Sepulchres with their hourely knells,  
> But you will visit grisly _Pluto_'s hall?  
> Behold where _Cerberus_, rear'd on the wall  
> Of _Hol'borne_ (three sergeants heads) lookes ore,  
> And stayes but till you come unto the dore!  
> Tempt not his furie, _Pluto_ is away:  
> And _Madame Caesar_, great _Proserpina_,  
> Is now from home. You lose your labours quite,  
> Were you _Jove_'s sonnes, or had _Alcides_ might.  
> They cry'd out _Pusse_. He told them he was _Bankes_,  
> That had, so often, shew'd 'hem merry prankes.  
> They laugh't, at his laugh-worthy fate. And past  
> The tripple head without a sop. At last,  
> Calling for _Radamanthus_, that dwelt by,  
> A sope-boyler; and _Aecus_ him nigh,  
> Who kept an ale-house; with my little _Minos_,  
> An ancient pur-blinde fletcher, with a high nose;  
> They tooke 'hem all to witnesse of their action:  
> And so went bravely backe, without protraction.  
>  
> In memorie of which most liquid deed,  
> The citie since hath rais'd a Pyramide.  
> And I could wish for their eterniz'd sakes,  
> My _Muse_ had plough'd with his, that sung _A-jax_.

##Ideas so far

Overflowing shit. Atomic shit. Ubiquitous shit. Breaking of economy through economy itself. Atomization of the body; flakes of skin and shit pervading every corner, every nook, every hole. Flakes of dead skin and shit; this incessant flight of death and shit is actually alive. Mold on the skin of the dead cat, roasted and toasted. That very idea of a broken boundary. Flood of shit. The most threatening idea of the poem is the idea of losing the boundary, of missing the boundary, of being no longer able of telling the difference between the dead flakes of skin that are leaving my body, and my very body. I am constantly desintegrating and becoming something else. Flakes of dead skin - the poem itself is losing its skin in fragments, and becoming the ailment of something else; the poem itself is eating shit and shitting. How, and are we sure? Is the poem really shitting? Yes. But is it really eating shit? Eventually, it does. Eventually, the genre that it had denied is reincorporated again - eventually the dead cat speaks - miraculous! - and metempsychosis is happening in London, right now, on the Fleet. Those are no longer delusional fables, pure fiction, lies. Those stories are being integrated by this very story.

How does the final section of the poem break the boundary between human and non-human? How does the cat speak in a human voice, how are his grey eyes the grey eyes of a human? Two ideas - physics and sex. Sex through a word - _Pusse_; dead cat bodies impaled and fucked, their skin moldy and toasted. Eating a cat is not much different from fucking it, in the end; it is not much different from being it, in the end; I become the cat, the cat becomes me. __Abjection__. Collective abjection. The _Fleet_ as the space where we throw shit away: dead cats, whores, desperate sick men, and epic. Dead animals, dead values, dead literary genres. Ferocity of the city disposing of what is no longer useful.

The opening is working. The opening is buying it, selling it - the opening is asking us to close our mouth when we listen to fables, but to keep it wide open when we listen to this. The opening asking us to open our mouth to ingest shit. Better still, the opening telling us that the shit that we are opening our mouth for is the _real_ shit; that we will not be dealing with the false shit. __Negation__. This is not _hell_, this is better - this is real; and, in the meanwhile, this shit that is real becomes the shit that is unreal - the myth is reintroduced, the epic is reintroduced, because it is impossible to set them apart, to tell them apart. Fear of shit. Fear of me becoming rotten carcass and shit eaten and fucked by cats. But if the carcass is floating in the river from where I get my food, my water, my sustenance, I will become that very shit - I cannot really keep it distant, keep it separate from me.

Bowels of the Fleet, bowels of London. Boiling and shitting. __Metempsychosis__ is the moment when, through physic and language, the discarded shit that I had tried to do without comes back to me. Ejection; repulsion; abjection; rebuttal - it all flows back, my dear old Fleet, you flow back to me, I have my mouth wide open to drink from your pure waters of oblivion.

Some work to be done with the mythology of the text. With the not completely worldly, not completely otherworldly, rivers of _hell_. Flowing from earth to the _other_ earth; and the notion of _oblivion_, of course. And Hercules - demigod - half human, half divine, his broken back, his stopped nose; remembered through his human name. Cleaning the flood of shit of the Augean stables.

Demigod. His atoms half spirit and half fart. Colorful _Atomi_ ridiculous.

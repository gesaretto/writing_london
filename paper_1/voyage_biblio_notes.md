#Books needed

1. Probably _Kristeva_ on __Abjection__ (either her or someone who's successfully summarizing what she says);

2. Ben Jonson: a description of the state in which he was when he published the __epigrams__;

	- There might be no __Cambridge Companion__ for BJ; but there is one _Donne to Marcell_. Find that, in case.

	- "An Eagle's Wing and a Vulture's Wing: Poetic Journey and Wager Journey in Jonson's “Famous Voyage”" - . Ben Jonson Journal. Volume 15, Issue 1, Page 54-78, ISSN 1079-3453, May 2008
		- _Stacks_: __PR2631 .B464__

3. something about __foreign trade__ in Early Modern London (for the ships sent abroad and the ways in which people had to wage on them);

4. something about __consummerism__ in Early Modern London (for the quickness with which a new item is bought, and an old item is discharged - trying to describe the terms of this economical transaction will be __crucial__);

5. something about the state of the __Fleet__ - not banal; we might have to ask B. about this.

- We should try and grab something from the bibliography of the amazing Robinson:

	- Jenner, "From Conduit Community to Commercial Network? Water in London 1500-1725"

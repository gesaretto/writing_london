  Abstract                 = {"Jonson's poem, conversely, uses a drunken boat trip into the choked sewer that was London's Fleet Ditch to parody the journeys to the Underworld undertaken by the heroes of the _Odyssey_ and the _Aeneid_." (247)

"Also, even by Jonson's own standards, the poem is discouragingly dense and elliptical." (248-249)

The entire article seems to be about the relationship between Nashe and Jonson, and about the way in which Jonson's poem would be somehow inspired by a previous work by Nashe. Not very useful for our purposes.

"And while Nashe uses pleasing techniques of fluid dilation, Jonson deploys frustrating strategies of blockage and obstruction." (258)

"While Nashe's poem rises to a succession of climaxes, Jonson's promises epic fullness, but delivers bathos and anti-climax. Like Nashe's poem, Jonson's has a preliminary verse: 'On The Famous Voyage,' which is followed by 'The Voyage It Selfe.' These preliminary verses make it clear that the poem belongs to the still rather unusual genre of mock-heroic satire, announcing that the journey chronicled succeeds the 'bolder fables' of the Greeks as well as Virgil's account of Aeneas's journey to the Underworld." (258)

"A tenuous analogy worthy of Shakespeare's Fluellen is drawn between the Thames boat hired by the poem's two adventurers and those used by classical epic heroes: 'Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none.'" (258)

On Shelton and Heyden: "Perhaps their obscurity, except among those readers who had drunk regularly with them at the Mermaid tavern, was part of the joke." (259)

"Indeed, much about 'The Voyage' is appropriately muddy." (259)

"To appreciate the absurdity of this itinerary we need to look at a map of pre-Fire London. Even quite drunk young men could stagger to Holborn from the Mermaid's large site between Bread Street and Friday Street in about twenty minutes." (260)

"One of the poem's many crude jokes is its glorification of the courage and endurance of Shelton and Heyden, and its refusal to acknowledge that of the poor pair of scullers, 'horride knaves,' who do the actual rowing." (260)

Is this really the case?

"Their waterway is the Fleet Ditch. The small Fleet Brook, a tributary of the Thames, had long since ceased to be a pleasant stream. Despite repeated efforts to cleanse it during the previous years or more, it had become a sewer and rubbish dump carrying much of the waste material generated by Londoners." (260)

"It gets worse. Though the oarsmen attempt to hold to the middle of the channel they suddenly encounter a monstrous 'liter' (lighter), a huge flat-bottomed barge used for carrying merchandise to and from ships in the Thames. This compels them to row directly beneath the outflow of the privies, where they are greeted by the sound of a monstrous 'crack' like thunder." (261)

"The poem becomes increasingly phantasmagoric and allegorical." (261)

"In epic terms, the cat corresponds with the hero's father, who rises three times from the infernal waves before giving prophetic utterance [...]." (262)

"This penultimate couplet lends support to such critics as McRae who construe the poem as a satire on the civic ceremonial of the City of London." (262)},

  Abstract                 = {Good work of summarizing everything that has been said about this poem.

""On the Famous Voyage" emerges within this context as an ironic commentary on, and disruptive intervention in contemporary constructions of space. The poem interweaves strains of satire and saturnalia, as Jonson maps a journey through a grotesque urban body."

"The infamously morose insistence on human excrement, I will argue, is enlivened by carnivalesque humour."

"Trave, if it is to be endorsed, must therefore be represented in accordance with its controlling ethos."

"Instead, given the number of other topical referents in the poem, it seems reasonable to suggest that the voyagers were personally known to the poet [...]."

"As Jonathan Gil Harris has demonstrated, however, representations of the flow of water into London were always equivocal, as civic pride was shadowed by associations of fluidity with bodily incontinence."

-> __VERY GOOD__ finding here. "As the heroes move upstream through the "dire passage" (l. 59), the poem moves haltingly through images of excretion to images of the preparation and consumption of food. The "passage" thus crudely mirrors the function of the alimentary canal, understood in Renaissance medical theory to be a single channel winding through the body, which received and digested food, and subsequently ejected excrement."

"Theorists exercised their minds, as Gail Kern Paster notes, to separate the processes of the canal, but failed to dispel completely the "specter of monstrous appetite, of ingestion and excretion in endless, horrible simultaneity."

""Dock" is a suitably confused pun, suggesting the vagina but also the anus."

"After the early imagery of degraded sexuality, the "Famous Voyage" in fact moves insistently towards a concentration on the city's processes of excretion and consumption. In accordance with the materializing strategy of the poem, Jonson roughly equates the "filth, stench, noyse" of the classical underworld (l. 9), with the unsanitary condition of the Fleet."},

  Abstract                 = {"These views rest on two important facts: that the poem is a mock epic and that it depends heavily on topical references for its effect. On the basis of these facts, I wish to argue here for a broader interpretation, that the real object of satire in "The Famous Voyage" is the age itself." (97)
"At the same time, the pervasive topicality creates an impression of realism and inclusiveness, making the poem into an image of the times. Throughout, however, the poet has proceeded with great irony. So what he celebrates he actually exposes as preposterous and repugnant, thereby fulfilling the satirical intent: to amuse yet to offer genuine criticism of Jacobean England." (98)
"Because the classics of Greece and Rome concern achievements which are no longer meaningful, a modern poet must update the traditional epic and celebrate virtue which is relevant to his contemporaries, Jonson therefore sings the "valour of the nose," a heroic indifference to what is foul and malodorous." (100)
"[...] the two heroes represent the decline of literature and science. [...] By including such matters in his satire, Jonson thus calls attention to the moral and intellectual condition of the age." (100)
Doubt between "Ralph Shelton" (praised and respected by BJ elsewhere) and "Thomas Shelton" (allegedly despised by BJ) as the referent of line 5. (100-101) For us, irrelevant: BJ is actually including HIMSELF among these heroes - he is a hero, braving this great threat. Same for Heydon (103 ff.).
Some time spent on the destination of the voyage, with interesting conclusions. (104-105) "The destination was some tavern near the Holborn bridge, which was the base of operations for "madame Caesar." a noted procuress of the day. She is referred to as "MADAME CAESAR, great PROSERPINA" (l. 180), who presides over "grisly Pluto's hall" - the specific tavern or inn. (104) But since she is away, the "visit" proves fruitless and the heroes return "without protraction," a phrase which further suggests the illicit purpose of their visit to Hell.
Summary: "Basing the narrative on the epic voyage and incorporating ancient mythology, Jonson thus establishes a framework of classical reference. "The Famous Voyage" obviously differs radically from traditional versions of the epic; the heroes of Homer and Virgil descend to the underworld to discover personal or national destiny, while Jonson's heroes journey to Hell to visit a brothel. Certainly the author is burlesquing literary pretentiousness, and lampoons Shelton and Heydon in particular. But [...] Jonson extends the criticism to society in general." (105)},

  Pages                    = {553-583},
  Volume                   = {81},

  Abstract                 = {"Early seventeenth-century England has long been associated with a pervasive disgust. [...] What no one seems to have noticed is that in one sense, at least, the years on either side of 1600 actually invented disgust." (553)

Follows a whole discourse on the invention of the word "disgust"; it is a piece about etymology.

"Descartes becomes the first philosopher to take disgust seriously, because disgust provides him with the physicalist model of aversion he needs for his associationist psycholohgy. He is accordingly interested in cases of a kind that concern Aquinas little if at all, as when we find something "very foul" in food we are eating "with pleasure" such that we are afterwards unable to think of that food without "_horreur_. [...] For Descartes, aversion is not the opposite of desire. It is a kind of desire." (554)

Great!

"Such aversion is nothing like the hatred or loathing that impels us to fly evil. What disgusts is precisely what we have once enjoyed, and it disgusts only because it has become too much, not because [555] it is fundamentally alien. The terrain of disgust is thus aesthetics or dietetics, not ethics or religion. It finds its place with "lower" senses like taste and smell, "lower" _techne_ like cooking, perfumery, cosmetics, diet, and purgation." (554-555)

"Early modern usage seems to move in the opposite direction: the word's sensory meanings increase in frequency [...]. But at heart early modern usage refuses to draw a line between the most visceral bodily processes and the largest horizons of human action. In disgust, the sensory and the social come into being in intimate mutual relations. This is not a matter of the body politic: the body is itself political, and the experience of disaffection is lodged within it immediately, like the unsettled movements of a queasy stomach." (558)

"In the pages that follow I will use _Poetaster_ and Jonson's final epigram, the "Famous Voyage," to show that the social topography of London is a vital context for a history of disgust, but also that the city scene challenges and complicates humanist discourse of taste and distaste. In both texts, Jonson shows how disgust works to produce new social identities. But he also calls attention to its paradoxes: the difficulty of distinguishing between tasteful refusals and poisoned palates; the strange pleasures that can attend even visceral revulsions." (563)

"For modern readers the most famously disgusting scene of _Poetaster_ is almost certainly its climax, which stages the poetaster Crispinus's reform as a literal purge of bad language [...]. This purge is a materialized enactment of humanistic education: it is literary criticism at work, a whole humanist socioaesthetics concretized in a single, graphic act." (563)

"The Jonson text that most intensely exploits the potential for disgust in city life is his last epigram, the "Famous Voyage." A mock-heroic narrative of a journey up Fleet Ditch from the Thames to Holborn, it is both a description of London's most notorious open sewer and a disgusting travesty of the epic descent to hell." (565)

"The "Famous Voyage" traces an emerging social boundary in early modern London; through its parody of high poetic forms, it links that boundary to forms of humanist cultural capital. And by devoting itself to a sustained violation of the rules of taste, it probes the contradiction of any cultural identity founded on modes of distasted refusal." (566)

Robinson sees the boundary set in _Famous Voyage_ as eminently __social__: "The poem strongly marks the difference of a "gentle" from a working London." (567)

"This violation of the rules of disgust is mirrored by a violation of the rules of genre and decorum, as Jonson dresses up the lowest subject matter in the highest language and turns the epigram - a non-narrative form, he insisted - into the basis of a mock-heroic narrative." (567)

"When the poem addresses "us / All, that are the readers," it singles out the basis of humanist identity, linking it to its own parodic mode: parody, after all, depends on knowledge. This literate "we" is implicitly separated from the working world the poem describes, creating a community of disgust that includes Jonson, the voyagers, and the reader, but excludes the cooks, clerks, carters, and prostitutes for whom, presumably, the Ditch is only a given element of daily life, not the material of either epic or mock-epic, and certainly not a place to be explored on a dare." (567)

"The poem stakes its claim on our attention on the suggestion that, for those who have internalized the discriminations of an urbane socioaesthetics, there is a kind of pleasure to be derived from violating them." (567)

"Despite the efforts of a few critics to discern a satirical agenda in the "Famous Voyage," the poem seems most obviously just to be about the filth it describes. There is nothing like an agenda, nothing like a critique, not really even a message." (568)

Final words about BJ: "The kind of ironic performance Jonson offers in the "Famous Voyage," with its invitation to enjoy the experience of disgust, its suggestion that there may always be pleasure in disgust, its suggestion that there may always be pleasure in disgust, makes little sense in the terrain of loathing sketched by Augustine." (569)

Impossible to resist this: "And yet in the lines that follow we can see fragments of this broken allegory, as Jonson repeatedly evokes forms of monstruous femininity: he imagines London as a grotesque female body with the Ditch a filthy channel into it, like Error's "hellish sinke" ambiguously mouth, vagina, and anus [...]."

"But Jonson equivocates with Martial's distictions by giving us centaurs that are really car-men and gorgon and harpies that are really scolds, conspicuously inappropriate equivalences that display the gap between the language he uses and the world he describes. The result is a product of subtraction, as first allegory, then metaphor, and finally poetic diction are all emptied out. The "Famous Voyage" evacuates poetic meaning, as the verse paragraph that began with the quasi-allegorical monster Mud ends with a simple act of naming: "Kate Arden" [...]." (572)},

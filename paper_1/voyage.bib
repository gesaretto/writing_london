  Abstract                 = {"These views rest on two important facts: that the poem is a mock epic and that it depends heavily on topical references for its effect. On the basis of these facts, I wish to argue here for a broader interpretation, that the real object of satire in "The Famous Voyage" is the age itself." (97)

"At the same time,  the pervasive topicality creates an impression of realism and inclusiveness, making the poem into an image of the times. Throughout, however, the poet has proceeded with great irony. So what he celebrates he actually exposes as preposterous and repugnant, thereby fulfilling the satirical intent: to amuse yet to offer genuine criticism of Jacobean England." (98)

"Because the classics of Greece and Rome concern achievements which are no longer meaningful, a modern poet must update the traditional epic and celebrate virtue which is relevant to his contemporaries, Jonson therefore sings the "valour of the nose," a heroic indifference to what is foul and malodorous." (100)

"[...] the two heroes represent the decline of literature and science. [...] By including such matters in his satire, Jonson thus calls attention to the moral and intellectual condition of the age." (100)

Doubt between "Ralph Shelton" (praised and respected by BJ elsewhere) and "Thomas Shelton" (allegedly despised by BJ) as the referent of line 5. (100-101) For us, irrelevant: BJ is actually including HIMSELF among these heroes - he is a hero, braving this great threat. Same for Heydon (103 ff.).

Some time spent on the destination of the voyage, with interesting conclusions. (104-105) "The destination was some tavern near the Holborn bridge, which was the base of operations for "madame Caesar." a noted procuress of the day. She is referred to as "MADAME CAESAR, great PROSERPINA" (l. 180), who presides over "grisly Pluto's hall" - the specific tavern or inn. (104) But since she is away, the "visit" proves fruitless and the heroes return "without protraction," a phrase which further suggests the illicit purpose of their visit to Hell.

Summary: "Basing the narrative on the epic voyage and incorporating ancient mythology, Jonson thus establishes a framework of classical reference. "The Famous Voyage" obviously differs radically from traditional versions of the epic; the heroes of Homer and Virgil descend to the underworld to discover personal or national destiny, while Jonson's heroes journey to Hell to visit a brothel. Certainly the author is burlesquing literary pretentiousness, and lampoons Shelton and Heydon in particular. But [...] Jonson extends the criticism to society in general." (105)},

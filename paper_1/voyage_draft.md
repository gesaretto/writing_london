The _Famous Voyage_ opens on a denial. "No," states the first line, "this poem will not be concerned with the matter of epic." And a sequence of characters and toponyms immediately follows: these are not the costituents of an _occupatio_, or _apophasis_, the refusal to include something that will actually coincide with the exposition of that something; these are simply _names_ that the poet holds in his hands only momentarily, to then get rid of them; he is assertively rejecting this tradition, he is discarding what he considers inferior to the solemn matter that his work will explore. The first six lines in fact open and close on this negative mode, that functions at the same time as a rejection of what is usually considered the appropriate subject matter of epic, and an anticipation of the alleged superiority of what will soon be said. The poet considers the products of classic antiquity _bolder fables_, discourses that were less valuable because they possessed no _power_ to _act_.

The rhyming structure in this section is especially concerned with the notion of denial and with motivating the reasons for which this denial is enacted. _Muse_ rhymes with _abuse_: the classical site of poetical production, if limited to the boundaries of _Latine_ and _Greek_ culture, is not enriching but deceiving. Paying attention to what these poets have to say is analogous to ingesting false values.

And the reason for which this is happening is expressed in the last line of the passage - these voices of the past were the voice of the poets, not of the heroes. The limit that is inherent in those narratives of antiquity, besides the fact of being false and deceiving, is their entirely lyrical setting; they belonged to a literary world that had no connections with its present. The poet is instead opening his poetical doors - the gates of his perception, of his poetic elaboration, to the forces of reality. A notion of porousness is implicit in this statement.

Even more radically, we should understand the _We_ of the fifth line as the inclusion of the same poet within the ranks of the heroes about which he is singing. The poet is not a narrator of a reality that is extraneous to him; the poet is that very reality. The poet is constantly braving the insurmountable forces of hell that the singers of the past could only phantasize about.
This anti-heroic mode of inclusion therefore possesses a twofold function: it starts describing the world of the poem as one of porousness, introducing the notion of abjection that will later predominate the text; and it lets the reader understand that the problems that are being described in the text are not problems that heroes are supposed to be dealing with. They are problems that haunt the absolute totality of Londoners who live around the shores of the Fleet. That _we_ is not simply opening the barrier between the poet and the unmatcheable feats that he describes; it is an _inclusive_ we, embracing the reader as well, turning the reader in a human capable of superhuman actions, precisely like the few lucky souls that will be described in the poem - _Shelton_ and _Heyden_.

The line drawn by the poet is separating this past, fictional reality from the reality that he and his listeners or readers are able to encounter and face every day. The reader is included among the category of the _we_ that the poet is writing around himself; this category is opposed to that of the many names listed in the six lines, and startin with the synecdoche of _Greece_. It is perhaps worth noticing that this synecdoche is then matched by a spatial synecdoche whose boundaries are more restricted - the _Troyes_ of line 4. The structure of this four verses opens with a denial and closes with the reasons for this denial - the _abuse_ of _faith_; these two moments are accompanied by the two synecdoches of _Greece_ and _Troyes_, one national and the second one _urban_. Therefore it is clear that the sight of the narrator has narrowed from the wide notion of national culture to the more focused idea of a _city_ and its _just knights_. These knights are _just_, but they appear in tales that deceive the citizens of London. They also constitute a connection with the contemporary fictionality of _fairies_ and just knights - with the contemporary fiction of _romance_.

The denial of these first six lines is therefore motivated by their distance from the _actuality_ of __London__; the actuality of London draws a circle that includes the poet _qua_ poet - this is not a fiction where the voice of the first person narrator is masked or replaced; this is Jonson's voice, exposing the horrors that he, as a citizen of London, is forced to encounter [__NB__: find where Jonson lived]. This is an __indictment__, written by one of the broken heroes that, every day, have to brave the same monsters described by the narrative. In any case, these first six lines introduce a denial - they open and close on adverbs of negation; they shift the reader's attention from the specific characters and toponyms that inhabit the general mythical landscape of _Greece_ to the community of _just knights_ living within the walls of _Troyes_ - and, en passant, it should be remembered that evocations of _Troy_ immediately matched the phantasy of _New Troy_ in Londoners who, like Jonson himself, had been educated with a strong perception of classicity. In any case, this is a denial that is rooted in the notion that, whereas the stories told about this classicity are fiction, this is a description of what Jonson and the people surrounding him experience every day in a urban space. And, as a poet, _Jonson_ discards everything that is not needed by his hand - he gets rid of the garbage of past fiction, of past _bold tales_. He is sitting on the shores of the Fleet, and he is throwing away everything that he won't need.

Perhaps the final note about this passage should concern, again, the system of rhymes. The rhymes already function in a deceptive way: they mimic the rejection of an item in favour of another one, but at the same time they indicate their profound contiguity, or similarity. They remind us that something of that discarded object will be present in the object that is replacing it now. But, in truth, these rhymes seem more concerned with the pejorative mode used to describe the vices of past narrators: their versions of _hell_ were just something that they would _tell_, and not experience in reality; their _Muse_ is capable of _abuse_, and very much so - not an ideal of inspiration or truth, but its mockery. Finally, the _got_ and _not_ is the denial implicit in the denial, or better - it is the absence that motivates this denial, the fact that in _Troy_ there was no common man capable of facing the horrors of something even remotely comparable to the Fleet.

This act of denial and rejection is consistent with other features that we find along the poem. A few lines later, negation becomes the factor of continuity between the experience of the Fleet sailors and that of the Trojan heroes: as they were crossing the four rivers of hell, we are told, their "wherry had no saile." This absence is matched by the Fleet sailors: theirs "had none" as well. Absence and negation become factors of continuity between the two experiences.

But the leading formula of these lines is not that of simple negation and rejection; the poet does something different and new here. Instead of simply rejecting the matter inherited from the past, he proposes a substitution - a persistent, systematic substitution between the old, insufficient elements, and the new ones, considered an improvement and an increase. This is the leading move of the following few lines. Everything is numerically intensified - for one _Charon_ there are __two__ knights, for one _Cerberus_ there is a whole coast of __dogs__, and so on. The exchange is also, as we have said, qualitative: the knaves that have replaced _Charon_ are "more horride" than him; the croaking that can be heard comes not from the natural element - the _frogs_, emblematic perhaps of a pastoral or even idyllic context - but instead from the human bodies gathered there - and from their _arses_. These two lines of improvement, quantitative and qualitative, possess a double valence: on the one side, they justify again the rejection of the previous, traditional matter - which is less and less valid; on the other, they seem to be the way in which the same Ben Jonson is trying to sell us the poem. The poem therefore becomes a commodity which requires a smart vendor in order to be fully appreciated: it is a new item that the reader has to buy; better still, a new item that the reader has to prefer to the old one, which will be discarded. In a way, Jonson is submitting the logic of genre to the economic laws of modern consummerism: the new form has to be chosen over the old one. This economic transaction is emphasized by the insistence on numerical values: one article is preferred to its parallel because its value can be quantified as numerically superior; as superior on a quantifiable, measurable scale. The contrast between _Furies_ and scolds, for instance, is based on a decimal multiplier, as if we were dealing with the equivalences between coins of the same currency, or between coins of different currencies.

The rejection is therefore founded on two modes of economical transaction, which will determine the choice of one genre - satire - over the other - epic; or, perhaps, of one topic or mode - realism - over the other - fiction, idealism; or, perhaps, one final one - history over myth; __we__ over __they__; _London_ over _Troy_. In any case, one item has to be preferred to the other; one item has to be considered better than the other, and this preference is accorded on the basis of numerical superiority - or a superiority of value - and qualitative superiority. But let us focus for a moment on the way in which this brief succession of comparative structures is accomplished. The first contrast clearly separates the _qualitative_ from the _quantitative_ mode of comparison: the knaves that _we_ have are __two__, _Charon_ was one; then, these _two_ are __more horride__ than him. The second mode excludes quality: it is simply a hyperbole that compares the single _Cerberus_ to the grotesque assimilation of the _coast_ to the legions of _dogs_ living on it. But the fina comparison does something different: it is located between quantity and quality because it works on the notion of value; on the abstract estimation that derives from an assesment of quality based on numerical, measurable criteria. We are not clearly told that there were ten times as many scolds as there were _Furies_; instead, we are told that each of these _scolds_ was worth ten _Furies_, regardless of their actual quantity on the shores of Fleet. This is a radically diffferent conceit.

From the justifications for denial that were mentioned in the opening lines of the poem - basically the ideas of falsehood and truth, history and fiction, us and they, the first person plural that can include the poet among those heroes that are capable of braving the horror of the Fleet every day - we move to an assesment of value that is structured as an economical transaction. The reader has to discard one genre in favor of the other because the new genre is worth more than the previous one. 

The twofold mode of denial and substitution are persistent throughout the poem. The poet concludes his introduction by talking about how the "former age" might have boasted its superior poets - or simply, its poets - but this is an age, and a city, of adventurers who are not afraid of the horror. Once again, Jonson is introducing this dichotomy only to include himself within the latter: he is not a poet, he is writing as one of the _adventurers_ who live within the city wall.

In conclusion, the poem is far from being a mock-heroic poem, or even an imitation of epic - it is a rejection of epic, a denial of epic, a refusal of epic. This is the initial move: an appeal to realism, to history, to truth; a rejection of everything that might be considered false and deceiving - of everything, therefore, that might be assimilated to epic itself; that vast apparatus of fiction and falsehood. This is what Jonson is doing. And he is doing it on the basis of a preference granted to the present state that is not only caused by its being __true__, but also by its being quantitatively and qualitatively superior.

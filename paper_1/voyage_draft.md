The function of the classic references that permeate Ben Jonson's _Epigramme CXXXIII_ has seldom been debated. Discussed for its "massive length," for its distance from the "encomiastic and condemnatory" tone of the collection that it concludes, and for its "disgusting" content matter, the poem, also known as _The Famous Voyage_, has nevertheless consistently been categorized as a "mock-heroic narrative"  [@Boehrer2002, 9]. In this "interweav[_ing_] of satire and saturnalia," occasionally "enlivened by carnivalesque humour" [@McRae1998], the names and the circumstances of Greek epic would simply be evoked with "great irony" [@Medine1975, 98], and to participate in a "parody of high poetic forms" [@Robinson2014, 566]. These labels, however, have managed to obscure the way in which the poem first repudiates and then welcomes again the elements of epic, in a cycle that mirrors closely the corrupt ecosystem of the setting that it describes - the River Fleet.

We could indeed compare the treatment of epic referents in the epigram's _proemium_, entitled _On the Famous Voyage_, to the "literal purge of bad language" which in _Poetaster_ embodied "a materialized enactment of humanistic education" and "literary criticism" [@Robinson2014, 563]. In a similar fashion, the poet begins his epigram by listing all that his narrative will _not_ include.

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  
> (1-6)  

Although reminiscent of an _occupatio_ - a denial to indulge in the narration of events that the same denial is in fact contradictorily relating - these first six lines do not reveal anything about the characters and places which they mention. Encompassed by a double negation, "NO" and "not", these referents are simply _named_, for the sole purpose of being discarded. This first rhetorical gesture is an act of exclusion and the setting of a boundary: before the actual incipit of the poem, "_The Voyage It Selfe_", the poet needs to push a number of elements outside of it.

A typographical mark, the same _italic_ font elsewhere personally curated by Ben Jonson [@Riddell2000, 156], signals the entity of the referents marked for expulsion. They are the proper names of classical heroes (_Hercules_, _Theseus_, _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_), to which is added a single, unspecified _Latine Muse_, and three places: a nameless _hell_, rhyming with the deceiving "tell" performed by antiquity, and two toponyms - _Greece_ and _Troyes_. The name of the country and the name of the city - suggestive of the _New Troy_ that is London - open and close the sequence, narrowing down the reader's attention from a cultural to an urban synecdoche, signifying, like every name on the list, the entirety of those "bolder fables" with which classical literature "our faiths abuse."

Falsity and superstition seem to be the main reasons for the disposal of this cultural patrimony. Analogous to the inhabitants of another notoriously fabulous genre, chivalric romance, the "just knights" of these "tales" are condemned because of their lack of "power," to which the poet means to oppose a true "act." As it has been observed, this allegedly true narrative produces "an impression of realism and inclusiveness" through its "pervasive topicality" [@Medine1975, 98]. The stark contrast between the third person of the first four lines ("they") and the first person of the fifth ("We"), together with the naming of two protagonists, "_Shelton_" and "_Heyden_", probably known only to "those readers who had drunk regularly with them at the Mermaid tavern" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 259], aim at proving the authenticity of the story. Classicity "brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer" (20): the poem is purged from the fallacious beliefs of the past, and pervaded by witnessed everyday experience.

The initial rejection is indeed followed by a fitting replacement for the discarded matter. In the following lines the poet asserts the superiority of his composition, both in quality and in quantity.

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> (11-14)

If the symmetrical absence of a "saile," elliptical about the "tenuous analogy" between the two vessels, might be an ironical marker for the clumsiness of the whole comparison [@Duncan-Jones2005, 258], the subsequent substitutions present an undoubtable increase in intensity and number. The poem will feature "two [...] knaves" instead of one _Charon_, and both "more horride" than him. The idyllic _frogs_, which in Aristophanes' play accompanied Dyonisus' journey to Hades, will be replaced by the noisy emissions of "Arses," with a shift that adds smell to sound. Pure quantity motivates the exchange between "one _Cerberus_" and a hyperbolic "coast" of "dogs." Furthermore, the refusal of the _Furies_ in favor of the "scolds," assimilable to the ideologically pervasive "process of commodity evaluation" [@Bruster1992, 16], overtly obeys to the principles of the marketplace. The _scolds_ are not superior to the _Furies_ in any specific attribute, nor are they more. Instead, working at the intersection between quantity and quality, we find a numerical correspondence between their worth - "each scold was ten."  Appraised on a decimal scale, _Furies_ and scolds function as the different coins of a single currency: we discard one and prefer the other because of their monetary value.

The literary dispute between old fables and new adventures is thus transformed into a commercial exchange, based on quantity and measurable worth. This monetization must have resonated with Ben Jonson's constant concerns about the "unprecedented importance [_of_] coins," and about the problematic "correspondence between an object and its [monetary] value" [@Burlison2010, 285] - especially at the time of completing his collection of epigrams. Before its definitive publication in the _Works_ of 1616, the series was "licensed for issue in 1612 as a self-contained volume" [@Miles1990, 170], a project which was never concretized. Nevertheless, the expectation of a published product must have been troubling for Jonson, who was probably still wavering between his affection for "the notion of coterie poetry and manuscript circulation" and the inevitable "lure of print" [@Donaldson2000, 123]. His poems, which he considered "more important than anything he had written for performance" [@Miles1990, 169], would leave the privileged space of literary circles to become another of the many "consumer goods that could never be deemed essential for life" [@Thirsk1978, 78]. The negotiations that give shape to the microorganism of _The Famous Voyage_ mirror the major financial concerns surrounding the public circulation of his works and his identity.

After the purge and exchange of the _proemium_, the opening lines of the _The Voyage It Selfe_ indeed reiterate the correlation between the transactions that inform the poem and those that grant its marketability. Through a number of specific references to "authenticated exploits of the day" [most of them successfully identified by @Donaldson2011, pp. 32-34], the voyage is compared to those "wager journeys" that "had long since established [_themselves_] as a recognizable component of England's pervasive performance culture" [@Manous2009, 3] : expeditions to "_Venice_, _Paris_, [...] _Berwicke_" or "_Norwich_" (33-36). In these circumstances, wagerers would actually "put on moneyes" _against_ the chances of the traveller. As Manous explains, "If the journey was not completed and verified according to the terms of the wager, the traveler forfeited this sum; but if the journey was successfully completed and verified [...], the traveller was typically owed [...] a threefold to fivefold increase" [@Manous2009, 8-9]. Similarly, the poet seems to be prompting his readers, here asked twice to "listen well" (28, 40), to invest the "three for one" (28) of their attention on this literary journey, which will be completed according to the terms declared at the beginning - namely the exclusion of the false beliefs of classical literature in favor of an original and authenticated adventure.

The poet has established an exchange based on the acquisition of what is allegedly both new and true, consistently with the principles "of a [growing] consumer society" [@Thirsk1978, 106], and enabled by the discarding of an old, fallacious tradition, signified by the disposal of the synecdochical referents in the _proemium_. As we have seen, Jonson had already compared similar processes of literary selection to a "purge": the fragments of epic and superstition that have been repudiated have thus become excrements, left behind by the sailless wherry of this poetical _Famous Journey_. This rhetorical gesture is of course consonant with the setting of the adventure, the river Fleet through which the two comrades are cruising. Already "become worse cloyed and choken than ever it was before" at the time when John Stow was writing his _Survey_, "by means of continual encroachments upon the banks getting over the water, and casting of soilage into the stream", [@Stow, 73], the river notoriously received the largest share of the "rich stew" deriving "from domestic and trade sources, particles of earth, soot, sands, turds and rainwater," together with "the oily discharge from tanneries and the noxious and toxic waste products of the dyers' trade" [@Cockayne2007, 199-200]. The Fleet had the exclusive privilege of collecting the waste issued by a number of privies located just above it; but Jonson had probably experienced similar "sights and (more particularly) smells" during "childhood adventures outside of his house in Hartshorn Lane" [@Donaldson2011, 103]. The tangible scatology of this landscape is therefore consistent with the poetical idea that informs the epigram.

The first half of the text is consequently devoted to the thematization of this literary and urban purge. As McRae has convincingly demonstrated, the leading motive in the description of the ditch is its assimilation to "the alimentary canal, understood in Renaissance medical theory to be a single channel winding through the body, which received and digested food, and subsequently ejected food." One of the most suggestive inventions of the poem, then, is that for which we follow the travellers along an unorthodox trajectory, moving "haltingly through images of excretion to images of the preparation and consumption of food" [@McRae1998]. Because of this inversion, the first threat encountered by the adventurers exemplarily embodies the collective waste matter of London. 

> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts due cluster,  
> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  
> (61-65)  

The poet insists on the notions of emission ("Belch'd forth") and ejection ("discharge"), while at the same time assimilating the bodily functions of the monstruous _Mud_ to the activity of the marketplace, where "carts" constantly exchange their "load." This excretion is therefore an integral part of the "natural, inescapable phenomenon" of "commercial transaction" [@Bruster1992, 16] in the organism of the city. This hyperbolical "discharge" of excrement is, in fact, intentionally provoked by its producers, who consume those "spirits, [...] pills, and [...] potions, | Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions" (101-102) which, "in shitten sort" (98), will purge their bodies from the unhealthy food that they consume every day.

As we ascend the alimentary canal individuated by McRae, in fact, we discover culinary practices that are everything but salubrious. The section of the poem concerning the "hot cookes" of "_Fleet_-lane" (145) is pervaded by the impressions of an incessant contamination, and reciprocal poisoning, between the waste discarded in the river - "grease, and haire of meazled hogs, | The heads, houghs, entrailes and the hides of dogs" (145-146) - and the food prepared there. 

The practice which perhaps Jonson seems to be most aware of is that for which "rottling in the back alleys and dunghills, pigs picked up contamination from city industries and noisome ditches filled with night soil and street sweepings.

 Mingling with digs increased the circulation of disease and intestinal worms. Some of these diseases were of course thought to be "transmissible to humans if infected meat was consumed." [@Cockayne2007, 95-97] In a rotten ecosystem, the animals "flead, and roasted | And, after mouldie growne, againe [...] roasted" had probably ingested the waste thrown in the river, before being again ingested by the humans that hunt and cook them. Introduced by the fantasmatic clouds of _Atoms_ that brood over the shores of the ditch, poisonous clouds of colorful "farts [...] late departed | White, black, blew, greene, and in more forms outstarted,"  A relative scientific awareness about the unstoppable pervasiveness of the "_Atomi_ ridicolous" described by "_Democrite_, and _Hill Nicholas_" seems to justify these anxieties: "bad airs - or miasmas" were thought to "caus[_e_] and spread diseases when [...] breathed in." As we reach the mouth of the river, therefore, we discover that what is ingested equals what is ejected: the horrendous discovery is that the two ends of the canal, the mouth and the anus, are horrendously similar to each other.

Indeed, although the thematical shift from excrement to nourishment described by McRae is undoubtedly true, we perceive that the alimentary end of the _Famous Voyage_ is disturbingly undistinguishable from its fecal beginning. There is a threatening confusion in the "monstruous femininity" of this London, evocative of a "grotesque female body with the Ditch a filthy channel into it, [...] ambiguously mouth, vagina, and anus" [@Robinson2014, 569], a confusion that might be compared to to what Julia Kristeva would define as "_abject_ [...], the jettisoned object" which, being "radically excluded [_,_] draws [_one_] towards the place where meaning collapses [@Kristeva2002, 230]. This collapse in meaning, provoked by a sudden encounter with the "body fluids, [...] defilement, [...] shit" and "death" [@Kristeva2002, 231] of the Fleet, is suggested by what, in the very proemium, Jonson describes in terms of "confus[_ion_]".

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  

The four rivers of Hades converge into a single earthly waterway, in a numerical equivalence that would still motivate our preference for the contemporary adventure over the old epic. Nevertheless, this sum presents a fault, introduced by the concessive phrase "save only": the fact that the rational, subtle distinction between the distinguishable, written elements of that poetical world is, in reality, turned into an unutterable jumble of "filth, stench, noyse." The idea returns in the neologism "merd-urinous," a compound chosen to describe the intrinsicably mixed quality of the waste found in the river, and in the invocation to _Alcides_ that is carelessly introduced by the poet after the conclusion of the introductory section. _Hercules_, the character beyond the patronymic, is indeed not entirely a _god_ or _goddess_, but a demigod, born of a human woman, _Alcmene_, and the god _Zeus_. This duality or even literal mixture, undescored by the reference to _Alcaeus_, his human grandfather, is then emphasized by the ambivalent way in which the poet lingers on the frail humanity of his "backe, and bones [_,_] sore" from his "former labors," while attributing to him an undisputable divinity.

> Thou hast seene _hell_ (some say) and know'st all nookes there,  
> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  

But this passage is remarkable for more than the simple repetition of the mixture motive: in this "confusion", like in the inextricablly _merd-urinous_ waters of the Fleet, the poet's forgetfulness ("me thinkes 'tis od, | that all this while I forgot some _god_") is actually enabling him to reingest the rhetorical material that he had just discarded, offering to the reader the exact same content that had been so scrupolously listed, denied and purged in the liminal space of the _proemium_. Even the same rhyme returns: accepting what "some say" and what _Fame_ has transmitted to him, the poet is in truth allowing the "_Muses_" to "abus[_e_]" both his and his reader's "faith". And indeed, in the murky waters of the Fleet all of this discarded epic material flows back to the poet, encroaching and soiling the setting, the adventure, and its characters. As the ship enters the "wombe" of the Fleet, the discarded epic flows back to it, in a mode that is "increasingly phantasmagoric and allegorical" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 261], and which parades "_Centaures_," "_Gorgons_," and a "_Chimaera_." Like "The slie _Ulysses_ [...] in a sheepes-skin," epic repossesses the poem, debasing the system of equivalences and positive replacements that had compelled both the author and the reader to wager on its success, and therefore corrupting the economical exactness of the transaction. 

Indeed, although in a different way, the ecosystem of the Fleet in the end seems to be comparable with "genuine criticism of Jacobean Engladnd" described by @Medine1975. Waste seems to have become an integral part of London's frantic consumption, which reached an unprecedented peak after the turn of the century, transforming "commercial transaction" into "a natural, inescapable phenomenon" [@Bruster1992, 16]; the risk of underestimating this pervasive marketplace, Jonson seems to suggest, is the "confusion" of the Fleet, where what is discarded becomes inseparable from what is being bought. And indeed, even Medine's extension of this critique to the realms of science and literature seems eventually acceptable - science might have replaced superstitious ideas such as god and the soul, but _Mercurius_ and _Pythagoras'_ metempsychosis return in the Fleet, under the forms of Paracelus' medicine and Hill's theory of atoms. In a corrupt, clogged ecosystem like that of the Fleet, culture is irreplaceable, progress is impossible, and ideas that you seem to have discarded will eventualy flow back to you.

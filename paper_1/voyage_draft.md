Ben Jonson's first move in _Epigramme CXXXIII_, also known as _The Famous Voyage_, is a purge. Setting up the premises for the journey that he is going to describe, and for which he is going to ask his readers to join him, he begins by telling us all that his voyage will _not_ entail.

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  

Accostumed to the modes of epic, we might initially think that this could be an _occupatio_, a topic refusal to indulge in the narration of facts that are actually narrated by the same denial (_example?_); but these first six lines, which open and close on _NO_ and _not_, are actually different: without giving us any true information about them, they simply _name_ these referents, with the sole purpose of discarding them. This first rhetorical gesture is an act of exclusion and the setting of a boundary: before the actual incipit of the poem, which will be signalled by the subtitle _The Voyage It Selfe_, the poet needs to push a number of elements outside of it. This is a list of referents that the poet wants to leave behind, and to do without; placed outside of the typographic boundaries of the _Voyage It Selfe_, this is the garbage bin, the disposable container. And these objects are bound to be thrown away.

A typographical mark, the _italic_ font, distinguishes the entity of these discarded, or disposable, referents. They are the proper names of classical heroes (_Hercules_, _Theseus_, _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_), to which is added a single, unspecified _Latine Muse_, and three places: an anonymous _hell_, rhyming with the deceiving "tell" performed by antiquity, and two toponyms - _Greece_ and _Troyes_. The name of the country and the name of the city in fact open and close the sequence, narrowing down the reader's attention from a cultural to an urban synecdoche. In fact, each one of these specific references serves as a synecdoche for those "bolder fables" with which classical literature "our faiths abuse."

Falsity seems in fact to be the principal reason for the disposal of this cultural patrimony. Analogous to the characters of another notorious fabulous genre of the time, chivalric romance, the "just knights" contained in those "tales" are condemned because of their lack of actual "power," to which the poet will oppose - we might assume - a true "act." The only indication about the entity of the adventure that the epigramme will relate is expressed by the almost incidental phrase "going to _hell_," perhaps suggestively asserting the destination of _Hercules_ and _Theseus_; nevertheless, the stark contrast between the third person of the first four lines ("they") and the first person of the fifth ("We"), together with the mention of two potentially obscure characters known only to the poet and his circle of friends, seem to aim at proving the authenticity of the story. Not Troy but London: this is what _we_ (my friends and I) know about hell.

These last two lines in fact introduce what will be the leading move of the following section: replacement follows rejection, and the poet asks his readers to accept the superiority, both qualitative and quantitative, of his product, especially when compared to the "fables" of "Greece."

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  

If the first line might be an ironical marker of the clumsiness of this comparison, since the absence of a "saile" tells us very little about the comparability between the two vessels, the subsequent substitutions present an increase in intensity and number about which the poet seems to have no doubt. The poem will have _two_ knaves instead of one _Charon_, and both _more horride_. The potentially pastoral, even idyllic _frogs_ that in Aristophanes accompanied Dyonisus' journey to Hades will be replaced by the noisy emissions of "Arses," with a shift in setting that adds smell to sound. Pure quantity motivates the exchange between _one_ _Cerberus_ and a hyperbolic coast of _dogs_, whereas the refusal of the _Furies_ in favor of the _scolds_ seems to function in an even more explictily economical manner. We are not told that the _scolds_ are worse than the _Furies_ in any of their specific attributes; but we are not told that there are more scolds than _Furies_ either. Instead, working at the intersection between quantity and quality, we find a numerical correspondence between them, as if the poet had been able to monetize their value.  Set on a decimal scale, _Furies_ and scolds function as the different coins of the same currency: we discard one and prefer the other because of their monetary worth.

The transformation of this literary debate, contrasting the old deceiving epic with the new realistic chronicle, into a commercial exchange based on quantity and monetized worth, must have resonated with Ben Jonson's preoccupations at the time of completing his collection of Epigrams, of which _Famous Voyage_ constitutes the last. We know that, before knowing its definite publication in the _Works_ of 1616, the series was "licensed for issue in 1612 as a self-contained volume" [@Miles1990, 170] : this must have been a complex decision for Jonson, who could not resist "the lure of print" while being at the same time "strongly drawn by the notion of coterie poetry and manuscript circulation" [@Donaldson2000, 123].

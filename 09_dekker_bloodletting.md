#A Patient('s) Bloodletting

_Candido_ is apparently the single character in _The Honest Whore_ who cannot decipher _Bryan_'s Irish accent: in __2__.3.3, the brief interaction between the mercer and the footman consists of a couple of comical misunderstandings, favored by Lodovico's disingenuous paraphrases. Thus, in an intentional distortion, the Irishman's inquiry about "de best wares" is turned into a comment on England's propension for "the best wars"; afterwards, a demand for "some _Hollen_, to make Linnen shirts, for feare my body be lowsie," is rendered as a possible criticism against "the Souldiers" laying "siege in _Holland_," who practiced "much bawdry" despite their being "lowsie." The stranger, who undoubtedly travelled to the city in search of a - potentially mutual - financial improvement, becomes the conveyor of an external perspective on England's international relations, and especially on those happening in an armed context. Perceiving a latent threat in the expression of these alien opinions, _Candido_ reacts according to his characterization: he first admits the truthfulness of the opponent's beliefs, in a timid crescendo ("It may be so, that's likely, true indeed"), and then mitigates the intensity of this risky acknowledgment by attributing it to a general human flaw ("In euery garden, sir, does grow that weed"). The dangerous concentration of a single national defect is therefore equally redistributed within a wider organism. Unsurprisingly, _Candido_'s justification of war is similarly based on the principle of balancing humors to avoid poisonous occlusions: "wars doe good, | And like to Surgeons, let sicke Kingdomes blood." Raised to the status of a military therapy for the illness of a nation, the medical practice of bloodletting seems to epitomize the essence of _Candido_'s resignated behavior, at times physically wounded for the sake of stability (__1__.4.3). Can we say the same of the inmates of Bedlam and Bridewell?

#Urban Glossing

_Cordatus_ and _Mitis_ remain on one side of the stage for the entire duration of _Every Man out of His Humor_. Like in the first few scenes of _The Taming of the Shrew_, two characters drawn from the context of the induction - apparently a circle of Roman intellectuals - comment on the events of the main plot. As they express their amusement ("Is not this purely good?" - 1.2.35), their disappointment ("this fellow's discourse were nothing, but for the word humour" - 2.1.69), and their understanding of the plot ("He is enamoured of the fashion, is he?" - 2.1.407), they either mirror or shape the response of the actual audience watching the play. But their privileged historical and cultural provenance allows for more than the simple, uninformed judgment of a casual spectator: the two bystanders are in fact critics, familiar with the conventions of the "_Vetus Comedia_", with the Terentian "laws of comedy", and with the problematically flexible history of the genre (Ind. 228-265). Their main preoccupation is therefore the notion of literary _decorum_: are the characters compatible with their description, and verisimilar in their behavior? Is the play consistent with its premises? The problem escalates, for instance, after _Sordido_'s attempted suicide, a "purposed violence" incompatible, for _Mitis_, with "the nature of a comedy": _Cordatus_ is then able to mitigate this disagreement by invoking the authority of Plautus' similarly dark _Cistellaria_ (3.2.139-155). Literally running alongside the main storyline, these learned remarks and intertextual connections function as the staging of its glosses, assisting the audience in understanding aspects of the work that depend on a potentially cryptic, far from immediate, cultural background. Is the parallel, inner commentary produced by _Carlo_ as he explains _Puntarvolo_ to _Fastidius_ and _Sogliardo_ (2.1.188-365) an analogous set of glosses, needed to read London?

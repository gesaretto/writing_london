#Presentation: Guildhall

On a fine Monday morning of 1598 John Stow and I are strolling around Cheap Ward, looking for "antiquities" [@Stow, 255] and interesting sights. We walk by the shops of "grocers and apothecaries" [@Stow, 256], smell the spices sold by the "Pepperers in Sopar's Lane" [@Stow, 257], peek into the Church of St. Sithes and that of St. Pancrate, wonder at the defacement of the "great Cross in West Cheap" [@Stow, 262], before eventually finding ourselves standing in the vast yard facing the great Guildhall (1). John Stow admires the magnificence of the Medieval building, whose construction - he tells me - begun under Henry IV, in 1411. "Look at the solid timber of the roof," he seems to be saying, certain of its perpetuity. Little does he know how dreadfully that same timber will burn in less then a century. Thomas Vincent, who allegedly witnessed the tragedy, recorded the scene in his "God's Terrible Voice in the City":

> the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view, for several hours together, after the fire had taken it, without flames, (I suppose because the timber was such solid oak) in a bright shining coal, as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of burnished brass. [@Vincent 50]

The Great Fire of 1666 is the event that most dramatically altered the appearance of the building (2): the higher part of the exterior - turrets, pinnacles, battlements - is where we detect most differences. John Stow is actually looking at the two domed structures on the roof right now, apparently fascinated by the thick smoke coming out of them. "Something must be happening in there," he seems to be thinking, "probably something important." The smoke indicates that an open hearth has been lit in the hall, and therefore that an influential decision is being discussed: the two structures, no longer present today, are _louvres_ (3), architectural elements used for ventilation in spaces lacking a proper chimney. They seem to have been the identifying trait of the building in Early Modern London, as we can see from maps and drawings of the time (4). Like the smoke upon which John Stow is meditating, the words spoken within the hall spread through the streets of the City, irreversibly affecting the lives of men and women: there seems to be nothing as powerful as an oration given at the Guildhall at the appropriate time. Perhaps John Stow is thinking about the fate of Edward IV, as depicted in Shakespeare's _Richard III_: this is the place where the machiavellian hunchback and his allies, Buckingham and Gloucester, manage to poison the king's reputation:

> _GLOUCESTER_ Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.  
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in a post.  
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,  
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.  
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen  
Only for saying he would make his son  
Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,  
Which by the sign thereof was termed so.  
[...]  
_BUCKINGHAM_ Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator  
As if the golden fee for which I plead  
Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.  
[...]  
I go; and towards the three or four o'clock  
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.  
> [@Shakespeare, Richard III - Act III, scene 5]

The "them" in Gloucester's speech is the first indistinct plurality encountered by these distinct noblemen, until now the unique actors of a conjure happening almost entirely within a private space. The Guildhall is the pebble thrown into the pool, the centre of a concentric set of progressively larger "publications," the administrative boundary set between the sovereign and the people. Here monarchs confront the councils that will decide over the lives of multitudes: from decisions taken in these rooms come those proclamations and bills that, in the final sections of Heywood's _Edward IV_, will determine the destiny of Jane Shore and her supporters.

But this is not the only reason for which Heywood, Shakespeare, and Stow, would have been associated this imposing building to the histories of Medieval kings. The Guildhall is by itself an eloquent witness of those days, a legible archaeological trace, left almost unaffected by the passage of time. John Stow leads me to the side of the building, right below a high glazed window, opening on "the mayor's court." He points at an image that he describes in his _Survey_: 

> the mayor is there pictured sitting in habit, party-coloured, and a hood on his head, his swordbearer before him with a hat or cap of maintenance: the common clerk, and other officers bare-headed, their hoods on their shoulders; and therefore I take it, that the use of square bonnets worn by noblemen, gentlemen, citizens, and others, took beginning in this realm by Henry VII. and in his time, and of further antiquity, I can see no counterfeit or other proof of use. [@Stow]

John Stow reads the building attentively, as if it were another of the many authoritative documents mentioned in his book. In those details he finds impressions of that nostalgic past to which his work is so piously devoted. And these impressions fittingly extend to his debated spirituality, as I soon discover.

We reach the entrance of the building, or "Guildhall Gate": the imposing white porch added in 1425 and preserved almost unchanged until the present day (1). Stow is enthralled by its façade; he points at another beloved sign of London's past: the seven statues placed above the main vault, three on each side of the central gothic window, and one above. These "beautif[_ying_] images of stone," as he calls them, are among the very few of their kind left in London in the Early Modern period. Approximately two centuries later, the sketches of John Carter would immortalize six of these seven sculptures (no.), identifying two of them - the male figures - as "Aaron" and "Moses." The lost effigy, as my guide shows me, is that of Christ, dominating the rest. This contiguity between the devotional and the civic realms seems to please John Stow, who begins reciting a sonnet composed by a similarly nostalgic spirit, "an attorney in the sheriffs' courts" employed in the same building around the 60s.

> “Though most of the images be pulled down,  
> And none be thought remayne in towne,  
> I am sure there be in London yet,  
> Seven images in such and in such a place;  
> And few or none I think will hit,  
> Yet every day they show their face,  
> And thousands see them every year,  
> But few I thinke can tell me where,  
> Where Jesu Christ aloft doth stand:  
> Law and Learning on eyther hand,  
> Discipline in the Devil’s necke,  
> And hard by her are three direct,  
> There Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance stand,  
> Where find ye the like in all this land?”  

Hidden in sight, these political and theological virtues are perceived and appreciated at an almost subliminal level, as a persistent, though silent, reminder of the moral and judicial authority held by the Guildhall and its institutions. But the integration between the religious and the legal spheres could also elicit some uncomfortable associations, especially for an intellectual like John Stow, famously accused of concealing Catholic sympathies. These courts and chambers are, in fact, frequently mentioned by John Foxe in his _Book of Martyrs_: here Anne Askew suffered her "condamnation" in 1546, sentenced to "death by the lawe of God" after having been called "an hereticke" [@Foxe]; here "the Archbyshop Cranmer" and "L. Iane" were "arraigned and attainted of treason" in 1556. John Foxe describes how, in this circumstance, "the comming of Queene Mary to the Guild hall," where she would deliver her decisive anti-Protestant oration, was accompanied by "such a feare [...] that a number of the Londiners fearing least they shoulde be there intrapped & put to death, made out of the gate before her entring in" [@Foxe]. Functioning as the administrative core of the Counter Reformation, the Guildhall determined the ferocious destinies of religious dissenters for more than a decade. The mental connection between its members and these unjust trials must have become so persistent that, at the moment of reporting a celestial prodigy, reminiscent of the evangelical "darkness" subsequent to Christ's death, Foxe cannot avoid depicting those same "Aldermen" as its principal bystanders. 

At the same time was also seene a Rainebowe turned contrary, and a great deale higher then hath bene accustomed. The common standinge of the Raynebowe is thus ⁀ but thys stoode thus ‿ with the heade downward, and the feete as it were vpwarde. Both these sightes were sene, as wel at Westminster, in Cheapeside, on the Southside of Paules, as in very many other places, and that by a great number of honest men. Also certaine Aldermen went out of the Guild Hall to beholde the sight. [@Foxe]

As we enter the building, and as we start walking around the perimeter of the impressive main hall (pic.), John Stow starts listing the "courts of the city" held in it:

> 1. The court of common council; 2. The court of the lord mayor and his brethren the aldermen; 3. The court of hustings; 4. The court of orphans; 5. The court of the sheriff; 6. The court of the wardmote; 7. The court of hallmote; 8. The court of requests, commonly called the court of conscience; 9. The chamberlain’s court for apprentices [...]. [@Stow]

The activity of these courts mainly revolves around the executive capabilities of four distinct entities, generally elected by the Guilds and by the Wards of the city: the Mayor, the two sheriffs, the Common Council, and the Aldermen. These distinct courts are assigned to specific rooms, located either on the second floor of the building, or in the offices and chambers bordering the main hall. These administrative spaces are nevertheless surrounded by a number of areas devoted to very different activities: a vast part of the northern side of the complex, for instance, is entirely destined to culinary purposes. Besides its fully equipped kitchen, "suitably fitted with every convenience for the supply of large entertainments" [@Price, 66], the structure hosts a bakehouse with four spacious ovens, a confectionary, and an entire yard allotted uniquely to the stocking of supplies. Consistently with its medieval origin, the Guildhall is famous for its feasts, and especially for the large banquet honoring the election of the Mayor. A few decades from now, Samuel Pepys will have the honour of partaking in one of these solemn celebrations.

> "We went up and down to see the tables, where, under every salt, there was a bill of fare, and at the end of the table the persons proper for the table. Many were at the tables, but none in the Hall but the Mayor's and Lords of the Privy Council that had napkins or knives, which was very strange. We went into the Buttry and there stayed and talked, and then into the Hall again, and there wine was offered and they drunk, I only drinking some hypocras, which do not break my vowe, it being, to the best of my present judgment, only a mixed compund drink, and not any wine; if I am mistake, God forgive me! but I hope, and do think, I am not. [...] By-and-by, about one o'clock, before the Lord Mayor come into the Hall, from the room where they were first led into, the Lord Chancellor (Archibishop before him), with the Lords of the Council and other Bishopps, and they to dinner. Anon comes the Lord Mayor, who went up to the Lords and then to the other tables to bid welcome; and so all to dinner. I set [...] at the merchant strangers' table where ten good dishes to a messe, with plenty of wine of all sorts, of which I drunk none; but it was very unpleasing that we had no napkins nor change of thenchers, and drunk out of earthen pitchers and wooden dishes. [...] The dinner, it seems, is made by the Mayor and two Sheriffs for the time being, the Lord Mayor paying one half and they the other." [@Pepys]

These festive occasions, which feature carnevalesque feats such as the one, depicted by Jonson, of an "Almain leap[_ing_] into an [enormous bowl of] custard" [@Jonson, _The Devil's an Ass_, 1.1], are invariably overlooked by two grotesque witnesses, inherited from a distant past: the giants of "wicker-work and pasteboard," Gog and Magog (pic.). The two statues are carried out during "Midsommer pageants, to make the people wonder" [@Puttenham?], but their home is the Guildhall. Throughout the years of their wonderful display, popular tradition has conflated their originally distinct identity: only one of them was a true giant, Gogmagog, the last indigenous inhabitant of Albion in Monmouth's _Histories_ [@Monmouth, 66]; the other one, Corioneus, was the Trojan duke who wrestled him to death, thus sanctioning the foundation of New Troy - London. In altering the warrior's identity, this belief has consigned the two characters to an even more remote history, antedating the very notion of Britain.

As our visit comes to an end, John Stow descends with me the staircase that leads to the two crypts (pic.), where we spend some time wondering at the bizarre decorative bosses, another obscure remnant of the building's medieval past (pic.). His _Survey_ does not mention these indecipherable figures, suspended between beauty and monstrosity; I suspect that their twisted illegibility troubles his sense of archaeological exactness. And yet, ambiguity is not exempt from his treatment of this mysterious space. In the section concerning the history of the complex, the crypt undoubtedly coincides with the original setting of the Medieval "little cottage," later turned into "a large and great house," where the first Guildhall was erected [@Stow 265]. But in an earlier chapter, devoted to the "Honour of Citizens," this orginal site shifts from here to "Aldermanbury Street." This inconsistency originated an unending debate [@Barron] over the position of this elusive, though persistent, past.

#Guildhall

##Outside

1. So, as our presentation opens, this won't be _my_ presentation of the Guild Hall; instead, I will ask them to have a look at the picture of the Guild Hall as we see it today, and then will ask them to imagine how John Stow would have been looking at it. I will say that we will adopt a __nostalgic__ perspective, and try to look at the item standing in front of us as it had stood centuries before.

1. I will go on, to _help us_ with this imaginative push, I have picked this image of the building as it probably looked like in the Early Modern period.

Welcome to Gianmarco's tour of the Guildhall. Please come ahead, and take a good look at the building as you can see it today, right below the Wall, in the old neighborhood of Cheapside. You can see a nice picture here - exhibit one, showing you what the building looks like today. We will soon have a look at the stained windows, at the vast porch in white stone, and at the adjacent chapel; many of these features have remained more or less unaltered for centuries. For now, however, I would like us to focus on an architectural element that has, instead, changed dramatically since the time that we are considering, namely the beginning of the seventeeth century, when many of the texts that we are working with were written, published, or performed. Let us try and picture the building as we would have seen it on a fine Spring morning in the year 1598, perhaps through the eyes of one of the writers whose works we have looked at - Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood, or John Stow. What would John Stow have been able to see? Look at the picture that I have included in your hand-outs to find out: it is the drawing made by Caroline Barron, an architectural historian, for a book on the Medieval Guildhall, a phantomatic problem on which we will focus later. Here she has tried to reconstruct the aspect of the building as we would have seen it at the end of the XVI century. Not much has changed, apparently, except for the higher part of the building: the tops of the towers and the bastions, and the roof itself. What we see in the drawing, and what John Stow would have seen in 1589, is an elaborate and refined timber roof, which gave an appearance of solidity on the outside, and of rich elegance on the inside, as we might see later. Our friend John Stow might find the object durable, but perhaps - at times - an idea crosses his mind: what would happen in the event of a fire? Little does he know that his fears might come true in less than a century. The most dramatic event that changed the shape of the building after the Early Modern period is indeed the Great Fire of 1666, which embraced the entirety of the structure and, according to the bystanders of the time, burned for hours.

> and amongst other things that night, the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view, for several hours together, after the fire had taken it, without flames, (I suppose because the timber was such solid oak) in a bright shining coal, as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of burnished brass. [@Vincent 50]

The roof was immediately rebuilt by the ubiquitous Christopher Wren, who tried to emulate the aspect of the former structure, and especially on the inside. We must therefore try and imagine the thing as it used to be, and to do that we will keep looking at this image. In fact, I can imagine John Stow looking at the roof of the building with a special sympathy, as he distinguishes on its top the two shapes that many Londoners might have considered the very distinctive symbol of their beloved Guildhall: the two pointed turrets on its top, depicted by Barron, and, as you can see, replaced by a single, closed form today. What we see today is in fact a simple decorative element, added to provide a touch of antiquity to the shape of the building; but back in the day the two elements, called _louvres_, had a very specific purpose. You can see some examples of Louvres on the following page. These architectural elements were part of the shilouette of the building, and very much so: in Agas' map they differentiate the building from allof the surrounding ones - the Guildhall is the one building with the two turrets sticking from its roof. Have a look at the drawings included in your hand-outs to get what I mean: which one is the Guildhall, you might ask? Well, it is the one with the two turrets sticking out of it! These _louvres_, therefore, identified as the distinctive trait of the Guildhall, had mainly two purposes: they would have been used to bring light into the building, but, above all, to ventilate the room. They were, therefore, large chimneys used for circumstances when a large, open hearth would have been lit. They indicate the presence of a large gathering, of a community reunited to discuss around a fire. The Guildhall would therefore immediately bring these ideas to the mind of the watcher or passer-by: a large congregation reunited to discuss important questions around a fire. This would have been, in the mind of Early Modern Londoners, a place of gathering where communities would engage in public conversation. The fire burning in the hall would produce a smoke that would raise up to the two chimneys, producing a sort of publication of the relevant business discussed inside the hall. There is a double motion here: the idea would be that of an enclosed place, of a familiar conversation happening inside, that would produce an immediate effect on the outside. The _louvre_ was a decorative element as well as a functional one. As we can understand from the pictures, it was not an extremely common setting. These were, therefore, the two immediate ideas that a Londoner might have immediately connected with the Guildhall, with its solid timber roof and with its two open _louvres_: the notion of a large, sensitive conversation happening on the inside, the smoke coming out revealing the incessant deliberation happening on the inside. It was a place of deliberation becoming public. It was, as well, the liminal space existing between the inaccessible rooms of the monarchy and aristocracy, and the civic engagement of the citizens. This is perhaps why Shakespeare chose to let Gloucester and Buckingham convene there as they discuss the fate of Edward in Richard III.

> _GLOUCESTER_ Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.  
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in a post.  
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,  
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.  
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen  
Only for saying he would make his son  
Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,  
Which by the sign thereof was termed so.  
[...]  
_BUCKINGHAM_ Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator  
As if the golden fee for which I plead  
Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.  
[...]  
I go; and towards the three or four o'clock  
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.  
> [@Shakespeare, Richard III - Act III, scene 5]

In Shakespeare's speech, the encounter of the Mayor and Buckingham with the Guildhall is the immediate transformation of their individual, distinct identity into the indefinite plurality of the political _them_. The Guildhall is the place where the seed of Edward's ruin is planted; where Buckingham's ability to _play the orator_ might result in the production of different _news_: news that might change the fate of a ruler. This conversion from the singular - the noble, the aristocratic, the monarch, and the Mayor - to the plural - the citizens, the courts, the aldermen, the guilds - is perhaps the crucial aspect of the building that we are going to visit today. Gathering the heated conversation from the inside and transforming it into the smoke and hot air flowing outside, the two louvres became the symbol of the building; they represented the communal effort happening within those walls, the incessant conversations would end would unmistakably always coincide with a public deliberation. This is at the same time the space where the singular becomes plural, and where the private becomes public. Something _well spoken_ within the Guild Hall would certainly affect the community at large; would certainly bring a change to the life of the City.

1. Perhaps more should be said about this point - shouldn't it? Perhaps we still have not grasped the essence of this passage. This is this value of _publication_ that, we feel, John Stow would be thinking of at this time.

1. Walking around the building - we still haven't entered any of its rooms - John Stow would have paid particular attention to its beautiful glazed windows, depicting pictures of the past. In fact, Shakespeare not only chooses to use the Guildhall as the place where the Mayor's intuition about Edward finally becomes a public notion, affecting the future of the king, but it is also the nostalgic move of an author that has to pick one of the long-lasting elements of its time. Shakespeare has to set the scene within a familiar setting in London, but he has to pick a place where time had, in a way, never passed for at least two centuries. The Guildhall, therefore, not only represented this sort of liminal moment happening between singular and individual, aristocratic and urban, private and public, but also the persistent link of the city with its past. It is a readable symbol of ancient times. In fact, if we are still following John Stow on this fine morning of 1589, the man might be probably walking us to one of his favorite sites, which he mentions in one of his passages. He is, in fact, interested in the looks of one of the people depicted on one of its windows. As he tries to describe the way in which previous citizens and aldermen used to dress in the Medieval - Chaucerian - past of his city, he takes the reader of his survey right here.

> more near our time, there yet remaineth the counterfeits and pictures of aldermen, and others that lived in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward VI. [...] : for a further monument of those late times, men may behold the glass windows of the mayor's court in the Guildhall above the stairs, the mayor is there pictured sitting in habit, party-coloured, and a hood on his head, his swordbearer before him with a hat or cap of maintenance: the common clerk, and other officers bare-headed, their hoods on their shoulders; and therefore I take it, that the use of square bonnets worn by noblemen, gentlemen, citizens, and others, took beginning in this realm by Henry VII. [...].

[@Stow, p.?]

The archeological attention of Stow reads the building and its element as if they were a written repository of the past; a reliable source of information about the customs of the city throughout the centuries. These glazed windows, like the rest of the building, were built thanks to the donations collected throughout centuries, from the moment of the building's inception, at the beginning of the XV century, up to the great fire of 1666.

But this is not the only place where Stow's attention focuses carefully. In fact, his nostalgia is activated again as he walks by the vast portal that you see in both pictures. Not only it is a beautiful testament to the talent of its Medieval architects; it is also the place where he could find seven of the few _beautiful statues_ that were still around the City at the time. He takes some time to talk about them, and even quote a small poem written about them. These were positioned right at the entrance of the building, as you can clearly see from the first picture.

> last of all a stately porch entering the great hall was erected, the front thereof towards the south being beautified with images of stone, such as is showed by these verses following, made about some thirty years since by William Elderton, at that time an attorney in the sheriffs’ courts there:—  
“Though most of the images be pulled down,  
And none be thought remayne in towne,  
I am sure there be in London yet,  
Seven images in such and in such a place;  
And few or none I think will hit,  
Yet every day they show their face,  
And thousands see them every year,  
But few I thinke can tell me where,  
Where Jesu Christ aloft doth stand:  
Law and Learning on eyther hand,  
Discipline in the Devil’s necke,  
And hard by her are three direct,  
There Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance stand,  
Where find ye the like in all this land?”  

[@Stow, p.?]

The poet mentions _seven images_, six of which are represented in a later drawing that I include in the hand-out. You will soon notice that the drawer of these few works distinctly named _Aaron_ and _Moses_ the two male figures, and you might wonder why. I do too. 



1. Better still, start with the picture drawn by Barron. That's a good one. Look at the roof.

1. Then let us look at the Guildhall as it looks today. What is different? The roof, yes!

> The original thing was in timber. And, of course, the entire thing burned down in 1666.

1. The whole thing burnt down in 1666. Quotation. This caused a vast work of restructuring and restoring; the very roof, for instance, was immediately replaced by the ubiquitous Christopher Wren, and stayed in place for two thousand years.

1. View in 1577. Look at the roof. The two _louvres_. What was their purpose?

1. The two _louvres_. They had this aspect, they had this function. What does the function tell us? 

> First view: the perspective on the city. First thing we notice - something that has disappeared: two sort of chimneys on the top. What are those things right there? What do they mean? The idea was that of a light placed there - of a way to expopse, to promulgate an idea; and, at the same time, the idea was that of letting the air flow. Two functions of the __Guild Hall__: one is projected towards the exterior - is the idea of publication, of projection, of importance - like a beacon; the second is the idea of a hearth, of a place for gathering and talk - conversation. Smoke coming out from the place. So we talk about the purpose of the place. Double purpose of the place.

> All right, a different proposal: we begin by talking about the exterior of the building, and about the two things placed on top. We have two options: we either introduce the timber roof __now__ (talking about the _terminus ad quem_ of our analysis), or we introduce it later - ironically, talking about the fire. I think I like the first option better. Why? Because it allows for a nice double transition: but it is still a little complicated.

> What if we started by the fire? Start by the picture of the building as seen from a distance. 

> This could be a place for the Shakespeare. Still some doubts about it.

> Then, here we have Stow's perception of the building. Stow talking about two items placed around the perimeter of the building, on its outside. One is the window - from where you could look at how people would be dressed like in the past. Yes, this works well with Shakespeare, I believe. 

> Religious or civil? The statues; the windows. The timber roof. It burnt down so well. (Some thoughts about chronology: what shape did the building have when Dekker was looking at it, when Stow was looking at it? 

> Some words about location might be necessary. What are we truly considering here? Here we show a picture of the small building surmounted by two _louvres_. What was their purpose? The place hosted a hearth, at times. It was a place for warm, cozy gathering.

> You cannot avoid talking about the seven or six statues, by the way. And - __yes__! You will not. The statues will serve as your moment of transition from the exterior of the buildings to the martyrs. Yes. 

##Courts

> And an obscure relationship with the building it was!

> Here we write shit from Martyrs' lives. And perhaps a couple of funny moments from _Price_.

##Kitchen

> Here we talk about the sumptousness of the meals. Then we transition to Pepys. 

##Hall

> The feasting: 

> Public place: this must be what Shakespeare was thinking about when he mentioned the place in one of the cardinal transitions of his __Richard III__. This is really where power meets the people; this is the node where power confronts the people - the higher strata of society asking, claiming from the king. [This is, of course, where Price sets the _Magna Carta_ in 1215. The moment coincided with the proclamation of a mayor in someone else's narrative.] 

> Talk about the gatherings. Talk about gatherings that might have been festive; talk about the idea that this is where people would go to taste, to perceive what was being said in the city. And to influence that. Perhaps this is the appropriate moment for the Shakespeare passage? To talk about that feeling of publication - of exposition - of exposure, of danger?

##Crypt

> But where was the building actually built? Visions of past.

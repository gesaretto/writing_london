#Guildhall

On a fine Monday morning of 1598 John Stow and I are strolling around Cheap Ward, looking for "antiquities" [@Stow, 255] and interesting sights. We walk by the shops of "grocers and apothecaries" [@Stow, 256], smell the spices sold by the "Pepperers in Sopar's Lane" [@Stow, 257], peek into the Church of St. Sithes and that of St. Pancrate, wonder at the defacement of the "great Cross in West Cheap" [@Stow, 262], and we eventually find ourselves standing in the vast yard facing the great Guildhall (1). John Stow admires the magnificence of the Medieval building, whose construction - he tells me - begun under Henry IV, in 1411. "Look at the solid timber of the roof," he says, certain of its perpetuity. Little does he know, I think by myself, how terribly that same timber will burn in less then a century; in the words of Thomas Vincent, who witnessed the tragedy:

> the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view, for several hours together, after the fire had taken it, without flames, (I suppose because the timber was such solid oak) in a bright shining coal, as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of burnished brass. [@Vincent 50]

The Great Fire of 1666 is what most dramatically changed the appearance of the building (2): the higher part of the exterior - turrets, pinnacles, battlements - is where we detect most differences. John Stow is actually looking at the two domed structures on the roof right now, apparently fascinated by the thick smoke coming out of them. "Something must be happening in there," he tells me, "probably something important, for all of us." The smoke indicates that an open hearth has been lit in the hall, and therefore that an influential decision is arguably being discussed: the two structures, no longer present today, are _louvres_ (3), architectural elements used for ventilation in spaces lacking a proper chimney. They seem to have been the identifying trait of the building in Early Modern London, as we can see from maps and drawings of the time (4). Like the smoke upon which John Stow is meditating, the words spoken within the hall have affected the life of men and women for centuries: there seems to be nothing as powerful as an oration given at the Guildhall at the appropriate time. Perhaps John Stow is thinking about the fate of Edward IV, as depicted in Shakespeare's _Richard III_: this is the place where the machiavellian hunchback and his ally, Buckingham, set to poison the king's reputation:

> _GLOUCESTER_ Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.  
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in a post.  
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,  
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.  
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen  
Only for saying he would make his son  
Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,  
Which by the sign thereof was termed so.  
[...]  
_BUCKINGHAM_ Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator  
As if the golden fee for which I plead  
Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.  
[...]  
I go; and towards the three or four o'clock  
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.  
> [@Shakespeare, Richard III - Act III, scene 5]

The "them" in Gloucester's speech is the first indistinct plurality encountered by these distinct noblemen, until now the unique actors of a conjure happening almost entirely within a private space. The Guildhall is the centre of a concentric set of progressively larger "publications," the pebble thrown into the pool, the administrative boundary where the sovereign meets the people.

two turrets sticking out of it! These _louvres_, therefore, identified as the distinctive trait of the Guildhall, had mainly two purposes: they would have been used to bring light into the building, but, above all, to ventilate the room. They were, therefore, large chimneys used for circumstances when a large, open hearth would have been lit. They indicate the presence of a large gathering, of a community reunited to discuss around a fire. The Guildhall would therefore immediately bring these ideas to the mind of the watcher or passer-by: a large congregation reunited to discuss important questions around a fire. [__Beacon?__] This would have been, in the mind of Early Modern Londoners, a place of gathering where communities would engage in public conversation. The fire burning in the hall would produce a smoke that would raise up to the two chimneys, producing a sort of publication of the relevant business discussed inside the hall. There is a double motion here: the idea would be that of an enclosed place, of a familiar conversation happening inside, that would produce an immediate effect on the outside. The _louvre_ was a decorative element as well as a functional one. As we can understand from the pictures, it was not an extremely common setting. These were, therefore, the two immediate ideas that a Londoner might have immediately connected with the Guildhall, with its solid timber roof and with its two open _louvres_: the notion of a large, sensitive conversation happening on the inside, the smoke coming out revealing the incessant deliberation happening on the inside. It was a place of deliberation becoming public. It was, as well, the liminal space existing between the inaccessible rooms of the monarchy and aristocracy, and the civic engagement of the citizens. This is perhaps why Shakespeare chose to let Gloucester and Buckingham convene there as they discuss the fate of Edward in Richard III.


In Shakespeare's speech, the encounter of the Mayor and Buckingham with the Guildhall is the immediate transformation of their individual, distinct identity into the indefinite plurality of the political _them_. The Guildhall is the place where the seed of Edward's ruin is planted; where Buckingham's ability to _play the orator_ might result in the production of different _news_: news that might change the fate of a ruler. This conversion from the singular - the noble, the aristocratic, the monarch, and the Mayor - to the plural - the citizens, the courts, the aldermen, the guilds - is perhaps the crucial aspect of the building that we are going to visit today. Gathering the heated conversation from the inside and transforming it into the smoke and hot air flowing outside, the two louvres became the symbol of the building; they represented the communal effort happening within those walls, the incessant conversations would end would unmistakably always coincide with a public deliberation. This is at the same time the space where the singular becomes plural, and where the private becomes public. Something _well spoken_ within the Guild Hall would certainly affect the community at large; would certainly bring a change to the life of the City.

1. Perhaps more should be said about this point - shouldn't it? Perhaps we still have not grasped the essence of this passage. This is this value of _publication_ that, we feel, John Stow would be thinking of at this time.

1. Walking around the building - we still haven't entered any of its rooms - John Stow would have paid particular attention to its beautiful glazed windows, depicting pictures of the past. In fact, Shakespeare not only chooses to use the Guildhall as the place where the Mayor's intuition about Edward finally becomes a public notion, affecting the future of the king, but it is also the nostalgic move of an author that has to pick one of the long-lasting elements of its time. Shakespeare has to set the scene within a familiar setting in London, but he has to pick a place where time had, in a way, never passed for at least two centuries. The Guildhall, therefore, not only represented this sort of liminal moment happening between singular and individual, aristocratic and urban, private and public, but also the persistent link of the city with its past. It is a readable symbol of ancient times. In fact, if we are still following John Stow on this fine morning of 1589, the man might be probably walking us to one of his favorite sites, which he mentions in one of his passages. He is, in fact, interested in the looks of one of the people depicted on one of its windows. As he tries to describe the way in which previous citizens and aldermen used to dress in the Medieval - Chaucerian - past of his city, he takes the reader of his survey right here.

> more near our time, there yet remaineth the counterfeits and pictures of aldermen, and others that lived in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward VI. [...] : for a further monument of those late times, men may behold the glass windows of the mayor's court in the Guildhall above the stairs, the mayor is there pictured sitting in habit, party-coloured, and a hood on his head, his swordbearer before him with a hat or cap of maintenance: the common clerk, and other officers bare-headed, their hoods on their shoulders; and therefore I take it, that the use of square bonnets worn by noblemen, gentlemen, citizens, and others, took beginning in this realm by Henry VII. [...].

[@Stow, p.?]

The archeological attention of Stow reads the building and its element as if they were a written repository of the past; a reliable source of information about the customs of the city throughout the centuries. These glazed windows, like the rest of the building, were built thanks to the donations collected throughout centuries, from the moment of the building's inception, at the beginning of the XV century, up to the great fire of 1666.

But this is not the only place where Stow's attention focuses carefully. In fact, his nostalgia is activated again as he walks by the vast portal that you see in both pictures. Not only it is a beautiful testament to the talent of its Medieval architects; it is also the place where he could find seven of the few _beautiful statues_ that were still around the City at the time. He takes some time to talk about them, and even quote a small poem written about them. These were positioned right at the entrance of the building, as you can clearly see from the first picture.

> last of all a stately porch entering the great hall was erected, the front thereof towards the south being beautified with images of stone, such as is showed by these verses following, made about some thirty years since by William Elderton, at that time an attorney in the sheriffs’ courts there:—  
“Though most of the images be pulled down,  
And none be thought remayne in towne,  
I am sure there be in London yet,  
Seven images in such and in such a place;  
And few or none I think will hit,  
Yet every day they show their face,  
And thousands see them every year,  
But few I thinke can tell me where,  
Where Jesu Christ aloft doth stand:  
Law and Learning on eyther hand,  
Discipline in the Devil’s necke,  
And hard by her are three direct,  
There Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance stand,  
Where find ye the like in all this land?”  

[@Stow, p.?]

The poet mentions _seven images_, six of which are represented in a later drawing that I include in the hand-out. You will soon notice that the drawer of these few works distinctly named _Aaron_ and _Moses_ the two male figures, and you might wonder why. I do too. The seven pictures were placed on the facade of the porch in 1425, and probably removed in the second half of the XVII century. The porch remained intact for centuries, and - apart for the detail of the missing statues - has been preserved precisely as it was at the moment of its erection. This contributed to its election as the crucial symbol of the entire building - the porch has been known as the "Guildhall Gate" for centuries. John Stow probably referred to it using this denomination. The overlapping between sacred space and civic space is in this case evident. The identification of the two male figures with the patriarchs was probably not entirely uncommon. The same has to be said for the statue of the Redeemer that we have lost here. John Stow must have considered this a tribute to a forgotten past. Always visible and always hidden, like in Elderton's poem, the figures must have been watched by admiration and resepct by the onlooker, John Stow. With sympathy, he would probably have stood there a while, contemplating this fusion of the past administration of his beloved city, and the symbols of his faith.

Entering the building, however, could have also caused some grim association in the mind of our friend. The beautiful roof of the hall, the glazed windows, the paved floor, prompt him to start reminding the reader of the many donations and genrous gift that were needed to make the rooms and decorations look like what they are today. But those very spaces had been the stage of a number of ferocious episodes. The place returns often in Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_. Here, for instance, Anne Askew suffered her "condamnation," being called "an hereticke," and thefore condemned to "death by the lawe of God." [@Foxe, p.?] These are the rooms, he must have thought, where once Protestants were condemned by Catholics. This hidden history.

This hidden history, we are saying, is what makes our friend John Stow feel uncomfortable right now. John Foxe had dramatised Anne Askew's confession as if it had happened right here.

The point being, that in _Foxe's_ book this was the place where the fate of many men were decided; many heroes of Protestantism became martyrs.

This was the place of deliberation and condemnation - _decision_; this was not the place of _execution_. This was the place where words became facts. This is where destinies took shape.

Again, the idea of liminality. Of place of _contact_. Monarchy and people. The _citizens_. The fear about Queen Mary coming close to the Guildhall; the idea of her voice resonating among those walls; the voice becoming the smoke rising up - the very air we breathe, we are breathing.

The scene about the reverted rainbow is not trivial; it is an echo of the sky opening up in the Gospel after Christ's death.

1. Anne Askew;
1. Queen Anne's oration to the Guildhall, and the condemnation of Cranmer and Lady Jane;
1. The rainbow.

Excellent. This is where Anne Askew was brought to proclaim her innocence; this is where Queen Anne pronounced the oration which led to the condemnation and death of Cranmer and Lady Jane. John Foxe tells us of the fear that possessed the citizens of London as the woman approached the building.

The rainbow. End with the rainbow.

These courts would be positioned around the perimeter of the main hall, as you can see from the convenient map that I have included here. But you will notice more rooms - offices, repositories, courts.

> Public place: this must be what Shakespeare was thinking about when he mentioned the place in one of the cardinal transitions of his __Richard III__. This is really where power meets the people; this is the node where power confronts the people - the higher strata of society asking, claiming from the king. [This is, of course, where Price sets the _Magna Carta_ in 1215. The moment coincided with the proclamation of a mayor in someone else's narrative.] 

> Talk about the gatherings. Talk about gatherings that might have been festive; talk about the idea that this is where people would go to taste, to perceive what was being said in the city. And to influence that. Perhaps this is the appropriate moment for the Shakespeare passage? To talk about that feeling of publication - of exposition - of exposure, of danger?

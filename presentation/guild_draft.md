#Guildhall

##Outside

1. Better still, start with the picture drawn by Barron. That's a good one. Look at the roof.

1. Then let us look at the Guildhall as it looks today. What is different? The roof, yes!

> The original thing was in timber. And, of course, the entire thing burned down in 1666.

1. The whole thing burnt down in 1666. Quotation. This caused a vast work of restructuring and restoring; the very roof, for instance, was immediately replaced by the ubiquitous Christopher Wren, and stayed in place for two thousand years.

1. View in 1577. Look at the roof. The two _louvres_. What was their purpose?

1. The two _louvres_. They had this aspect, they had this function. What does the function tell us? 

> First view: the perspective on the city. First thing we notice - something that has disappeared: two sort of chimneys on the top. What are those things right there? What do they mean? The idea was that of a light placed there - of a way to expopse, to promulgate an idea; and, at the same time, the idea was that of letting the air flow. Two functions of the __Guild Hall__: one is projected towards the exterior - is the idea of publication, of projection, of importance - like a beacon; the second is the idea of a hearth, of a place for gathering and talk - conversation. Smoke coming out from the place. So we talk about the purpose of the place. Double purpose of the place.

> All right, a different proposal: we begin by talking about the exterior of the building, and about the two things placed on top. We have two options: we either introduce the timber roof __now__ (talking about the _terminus ad quem_ of our analysis), or we introduce it later - ironically, talking about the fire. I think I like the first option better. Why? Because it allows for a nice double transition: but it is still a little complicated.

> What if we started by the fire? Start by the picture of the building as seen from a distance. 

> This could be a place for the Shakespeare. Still some doubts about it.

> Then, here we have Stow's perception of the building. Stow talking about two items placed around the perimeter of the building, on its outside. One is the window - from where you could look at how people would be dressed like in the past. Yes, this works well with Shakespeare, I believe. 

> Religious or civil? The statues; the windows. The timber roof. It burnt down so well. (Some thoughts about chronology: what shape did the building have when Dekker was looking at it, when Stow was looking at it? 

> Some words about location might be necessary. What are we truly considering here? Here we show a picture of the small building surmounted by two _louvres_. What was their purpose? The place hosted a hearth, at times. It was a place for warm, cozy gathering.

> You cannot avoid talking about the seven or six statues, by the way. And - __yes__! You will not. The statues will serve as your moment of transition from the exterior of the buildings to the martyrs. Yes. 

##Courts

> And an obscure relationship with the building it was!

> Here we write shit from Martyrs' lives. And perhaps a couple of funny moments from _Price_.

##Kitchen

> Here we talk about the sumptousness of the meals. Then we transition to Pepys. 

##Hall

> The feasting: 

> Public place: this must be what Shakespeare was thinking about when he mentioned the place in one of the cardinal transitions of his __Richard III__. This is really where power meets the people; this is the node where power confronts the people - the higher strata of society asking, claiming from the king. [This is, of course, where Price sets the _Magna Carta_ in 1215. The moment coincided with the proclamation of a mayor in someone else's narrative.] 

> Talk about the gatherings. Talk about gatherings that might have been festive; talk about the idea that this is where people would go to taste, to perceive what was being said in the city. And to influence that. Perhaps this is the appropriate moment for the Shakespeare passage? To talk about that feeling of publication - of exposition - of exposure, of danger?

##Crypt

> But where was the building actually built? Visions of past.

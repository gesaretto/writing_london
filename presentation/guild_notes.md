##From __Price__

- The book opens with a quotation from Richard III - Guildhall is the place which embodied the past in the eyes of Early Modern Londoners.

- "while there is no public edifice that for so many centuries has been more identified with the fortunes of the City than has its Guildhall, yet there is no existing structure, ecclesiastical or civil, which appears to have received so little attention at the hands of the antiquarian enquirer."

- "we contemplate its connection with the incident chronicled by Shakespeare, with the sometimes turbulent gatherings, or at others, gorgeous pageants of the Middle Ages, the trials of Lady Jane Grey, her ill-fated husband and the aged Cranmer, with other to be noted"

- "with the esception of the information collected by that enthusiastic and ever-to-be-remembered lover of London history, John Stow, there is scarcely anything on record"

- "To fully appreciate the historical interest of the Guildhall and its surroundings, it is necessary to devote a brief consideration to the origin and development of that municipal life which has made the City what it is; and to study a little the history of our country and its capital, at a period not only prior to the investigations of Stow and other writers, but of one long anterior to the existence of the City archives themselves."

- - -

- __p. 54__ there is a specific importance in the fact that the Hall had been _paved_ and _glazed_; "Sir Richard's association with the glazing of the windows of the Hall is commemorated in a play by Thomas Heywood, on the "Life and Reign of Queen Elizabeth," originally published in 1606."

- __NB__: consider how this hall has been both the stage of the Reformation and the site where the last _statues_ dear to Stow had been preserved.

- The __windows__ are about 16, on all sides of the hall.

- __NB__: Price's observations on the themes depicted on the windows of Guildhall are not at all trivial; he conjectures that, together with the citizens reported by Stow, on these glazed surfaces there might have been images of saints and holy figures; therefore, they were "pulled down" in 1642 (Price, 56). Remember - this is the beginning of the English __Civil War__: not something that we should be directly concerned with.

- Keep in mind the enlargement and renovation of __1411__; it is the event that shaped the Guildhall as it was known to Early Modern Londoners.

- Price's precious books describes two __Louvres__, "which were at one time such prominent objects upon the roof of the old Hall. In the early views of the building taken previous of the __Fire of 1666__ [together with the iconoclastic destruction of the Civil War, this should be considered our _terminus ad quem_] these small lanterns or turrets are readily discerned. They were for the purpose of ventilation or if fires were lighted, as was often customary upon an open hearth, they would be necessary in order to allow for the escape of smoke." [Price, you are a distinctly awkward writer.] (57)

- __NB__: it is unclear whether these two things were actually there or not, or when precisely they appeared. An educated guess would be between mid s. XVI and end s. XVII.

- The __kitchen__ was added in __1501__; it was used to cook the large meals that would accompany major events, such as the __annual feast__ in Guildhall (p. 63), which would host "the customary banquet on the installation of the Mayor." The guilds financially contributed to the setting up of this facility.

- "The Bakehouse of Guildhall was situated beneath the north end of the Court of King's bench; it was furnished with four spacious ovens in two tiers, the mouths opening into the west wall of the Court, and the whole projecting into the Confectionery Room, where there was a small oven, and other arrangements over the crown of the large ovens [...]."

- "An internal doorway connected the foregoing with the Kitchen. It was suitably fitted with every convenience for the supply of large entertainments." (66)

- The roof of Guildhall was probably in timber. That is why the whole thing burnt so well during the 1666 fire. "That night (Tuesday, 4th September, 1666) the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view for several hours together in view for several hours together after the Fire had taken it, without flames (I suppose because the timber was of such solid oake) in a bright shining coale, as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of burnished brass." (67), quoting Vincent's "God's terrible voice in the City" 1667 p. 66

- Problem about the original material used to build it (discussion from s. XIX - Price's times): stone or timber?

- The __porch__ added in 1425, as Stow tells us, is perhaps the most prominent element of the building in Early Modern eyes. "This addidtion to the Hall was one of the most imposing features of the edifice, and prior to the alterations from the designs of Mr. Dance in the year 1789, was considerably in advance of the main building. Though subjected to minor alterations from time to time, its chief points of interest are uninjured. These combine two bays of groined vaulting, the vaults having deeply recessed, moulded, and traceried panelling, varied where the side doorways to the Comptroller's office, Crypt, and Library corridor occur, and being provided with a convenient bench against the side walls. The vaulting is richly groined with moulded principal and secondary ribs, springing from corresponding pillars, the intersections being enriched with handsome sculptured bosses of heraldic and foliated devices in varied designs, emblazoned and gilt, the two principal bosses bearing the Arms of Edward the Confessor and Henry VI. Among the others is the eagle of St. John, the bull of St. Luke, the lion of St. Mark, the angel of St. Mathew, and the monogram __ihs__ for Jesus. Mr. Nichols remarks that the structure terminated with a straight parapet and quatre-foil ornaments, over which were placed the Royal Arms of England in a heavy square frame supported by scrolls. Round the lower part of the balcony were the Arms of thirty-four of the City companies. The Porch was known as the "Guildhall Gate," and has been so recognised [...] in much of the literature of the same period." (70-71)

- The __seven statues__: we have a picture of them: for Price they "were choice specimens of medieval architecture, and deserve more than a passing notice." Were they __seven__ or __six__? Price thinks that "From the description given by Elderton it would seem that the missing figure is that of our Saviour; this would in all probablility have been placed upon the others, and probably upon the Gothic window [...].

- Quotation about Gog and Magog in __Machyn's Diary__ "In 1533 on "the xvij of Marche cam through London from Algatt, Master Maynard, the Sheryff of London, with a standard and dromes, and after gyants both great and small." (92) - Puttenham has a similar quotation: "Midsommer pageants in London, where, to make the people wonder, are set forth great and uglie gyants, marching as if they were alive, and armed at all points"

- from Nichols' book on _Chrysanaleia_, the Golden Fishing: "The figures, continues Mr. Nichols, which were made for Guildhall after the Great Fire, were drawn on the street in the Lord Mayor's show of 1672, when they are spoken as "two extreme great Giants, each of them at least fifteen foot high, that do sit and are drawn by horses in two several chariots, moving, talking, and taking tobacco as they ride along, to the great admiration and delight of all the spectators." (94) "There is also a reference to the Giants in the "Iter Boreale," written by Bishop Corbet, in the reign of James I. Comparing them with similar figures at Holmby, the residence of Sir Christopher Hatton, he says -

> "Oh you, that do Guildhall and Holmeby keep  
> Soe carefully, when both the founders sleepe,  
> You are good giants."  

- The grotesque figures in the __crypt__ are worth showing or mentioning.

- A __chapel__ was certainly already part of the complex. "This sacred edifice was situate in close proximity to the Hall. It was dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen and All Saints" (110).

- __Library__ and its expoliation: "Fuller, in his history of the time, is among the historians who indignantly bewail the loss, and quotes the following curious extract from the writings of Bale, the Centurist. "Covetousnesse," says the author, "was at that time so busy about private commodity that publick wealth was not anywhere regarded. A number of them which purchased those superstitious mansions reserved of those library books, some to serve their jokes, some to scour their candlesticks, and some to rub their boots." (128) - __USELESS__!

- Apparently __Stow__ has a description of the tombs found in the chapel. Necessary to check again. The names are "Richard Stomine" and unknown.

- The front of the __chapel__ featured - apparently - three statued sculpted around the beginning of s. XVII.

- Price has a number of Early Modern quotations about the Mayor's Banquet - they all deal with a strange ritual involving an enormous bowl of _custard_ and someone jumping into it. Ben Jonson in _The Devil's an Ass_ (1.1):

> "He may perchance, in tail of a Sheriff's dinner  
> Skip with a rhyme on the table, from New-nothing  
> And take his Almain leap into a custard  
> Shall make my Lady Mayoress and her sisters  
> Laugh all their hoods over their shoulders."  

- Price moves from here to __Lady Jane Grey__ (from the ludicrous to the tragic - good job!).

- - -

- The final part of the book is concerned with the __museum__. 

- __NB__: this (Price's volume) is a remarkably useful source, therefore we will be spending some time on it.

##From __Stow__

-  The great description of the history of the Guildhall is in the section devoted to Cheape Ward; here we find a list of the various courts held at the Guildhall, a history of its erection, and a description of its __statues__.

- By the Guildhall a special __college__ was erected; we should understand how connected the two institutions were.

- Guildhall also hosted a __library__. Important stuff; it probably still does.

- (Guildhall as the keeper of the past.)

- In the section about the _sheriffs and mayors of London_, Stow tells the reader how he has "read in books of accounts in the Guildhall;" our old friend was using this library as well. And how could we blame him? This must have been among his favorite places.

- In the section about the _liveries_ we have an interesting digression on a detail of the Guildhall: "more near our time, there yet __remaineth the counterfeits and pictures of aldermen__, and others that lived in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward VI., [_namely alderman Darby dwelling in Fenchurch street, over against the parish church of St. Diones, left his picture, as of an alderman, in a gown of scarlet on his back, a hood in his head, etc., as is in that house (and elsewhere) to be seen:_] for a further monument of those late times, men may behold the glass windows of the mayor's court in the Guildhall above the stairs, the mayor is there pictured sitting in habit, party-coloured, and a hood on his head, his swordbearer before him with a hat or cap of maintenance: the common clerk, and other officers bare-headed, their hoods on their shoulders; and therefore I take it, that the use of square bonnets worn by noblemen, gentlemen, citizens, and others, took beginning in this realm by Henry VII. and in his time, and of further antiquity, I can see no counterfeit or other proof."

	- _What is noticeable here_ is the fact that Stow is __reading__ the very building; Stow is looking at the building in order to discover details related to the City's past customs.

##From __Baddeley__

- First crucial piece of information: towards the end of the __XIX__ century, Guildhall started collecting and compiling _pieces of its own past_.

- The _ab ovo_ of Baddeley is the aftermath of the Norman conquest; he pictures Coeur-de-Lion's "martial figure striding at times through the Hall" (8).

- This seems to be the space where the __mediation__ between the City and its rulers takes place; this is the house of __the citizens__; Baddeley stages here the "wrestling" of the Magna Carta from the reluctant John (1215).

	- In fact, this is precisely how __Shakespeare__ understands the place in _Richard III_.

- The building is also the __center__ of Medieval London.

- In the brief survey of the hall's history by Beddeley, a __table__ seems to possess an unusual importance.

- "Yet, at the same period, in this same Guildhall of ours, we are pleased to picture grave citizens pacing the floor, full of pious schemes for the advancement of learning, which resulted in the establishment of the world-famed schools of the Mercers, St. Paul's, the Merchant Taylors, and others in the City;"

- This episode contrasts with the trial and burning of Anne Askew (1546).

- The Guildhall is the place where the Reformation takes place. We should have a look at the __Book of Martyrs__: here we have Cranmer and Jane Grey. [__NOTHING__, apparently, in the BoM.]

- Guildhall as a stage, of course. Early Modern culture of theater as a reaction to the Reformation: the world becomes a stage - forgetful, impotent against change, incapable of influencing history, of retaining history - because history has changed so often; kings have changed so often, their beliefs and allegiances have changed so often.

- __Elizabethan__ times: "The Guildhall is alive and astir with the merchant adventurers, whose minds are deeply engaged in plans for the extensions of trade wherever they can set foot in a world for the most part as yet unknown."

	- __Crucial question__: can we really assimilate these adventurers and explorers into the ranks of the _citizens_? Think about __EH__: there the two circumstances seem to be antithetical: it is one thing to travel abroad while following the intangible prospect of the __west__, it is another to stay in London, like our old friend Touchstone, and rely on the _status quo_.

- "We catch glimpses of Sir Thomas Gresham pondering how he may best carry out his father's scheme for founding a "Burse" or Exchange, for the use of the rising merchants, and how he may best arrange his noble scheme for a college

	 - wait, does this mean that the __Guildhall__ hosted a __burse__ as well? That would be _truly_ interesting.

- Early in April, 1588, the Common Council assemble with grave and troubled, but corageous looks, knowing full well that England's time of trial has come, and agree to furnish and fully equip for war, sixteen of the largest and best merchant ships that can be found in the Thames, and four pinnaces to attend on them; and we again see them on that eventful Saturday, when an engagement with the Spaniard is expected, obeying the precept of the Lord Mayor (Sir George Bond) to attend church [...]" (14)

- __HERE IS A USEFUL NOTE__ "On the proposed Royal alliance with their ancient enemy of Spain, we can imagine the bold and independent City apprentices assembling around the Guildhall, full of contempt for their haughty foe, and venting their feelings against its representative, Gondomar, who, upon giving directions to the Mayor, is met with the reply, "It is not to you that I have to give an account for the government of this City." (15)

	- And think about __collective spaces__; cybernetics.

- _Pepys_ in the __Guildhall__! __1663))

	- "We went up and down to see the tables, where, under every salt, there was a bill of fare, and at the end of the table the persons proper for the table. Many were at the tables, but none in the Hall but the Mayor's and Lords of the Privy Council that had napkins or knives, which was very strange. We went into the Buttry and there stayed and talked, and then into the Hall again, and there wine was offered and they drunk, I only drinking some hypocras, which do not break my vowe, it being, to the best of my present judgment, only a mixed compund drink, and not any wine; if I am mistake, God forgive me! but I hope, and do think, I am not. [...] By-and-by, about one o'clock, before the Lord Mayor come into the Hall, from the room where they were first led into, the Lord Chancellor (Archibishop before him), with the Lords of the Council and other Bishopps, and they to dinner. Anon comes the Lord Mayor, who went up to the Lords and then to the other tables to bid welcome; and so all to dinner. I set [...] at the merchant strangers' table where ten good dishes to a messe, with plenty of wine of all sorts, of which I drunk none; but it was very unpleasing that we had no napkins nor change of thenchers, and drunk out of earthen pitchers and wooden dishes. [...] The dinner, it seems, is made by the Mayor and two Sheriffs for the time being, the Lord Mayor paying one half and they the other." (19 in Baddeley).

- What __Baddeley__ has to say about the fire: "Wren examines the Guildhall and finds that the walls are almost uninjured, and three years after places thereon a roof, it is said, intended only to be temporary, though destined to remain for nearly 200 years." (20)

- __Baddeley__ steals his descriptions of the building from __Prince__. Still impressive, though. On p. 35 we have two pictures of the Arms of Ed. Confessor and Henry VI.

- Mysterious quotation: "the place where the citizens have for ages been accostumed to assemble, not only to transact municipal business, but also freely to discuss public grievances, to consider and suggest remedies for great social evils, and to promote the general interests of humanity." He continues: "We are at once struck with its magnificent proportions and general appearance of vastness - a vastness enchanced by its beautiful open timbered roof." (35)

- __Baddeley__ is superuseful. "Space will not permit of any mention of the various traditions and speculations as to the existence of a Hall as the meeting place of the citizens, and where, in after years, the various Trade Guilds met for the transaction of business, earlier than the reign of Edward the Confessor, A.D. 1041-1066, and that there was one at that time can only be surmised from the fact, that the arms of Edward appear not only in the Porch, but in the Crypt, and other portions of the present Guildhall. [...] otherwise the Arms would hardly have been selected as a companion to those of Henry VI., in whose reign the present Hall was completed." [Henry VI: 1421-1471; king 1422-1461 then 1470-1471]

- "Early in the 15th century the necessities of the time caused by the improvement of commerce at home, and the increase of trade with foreign countries, led to an enlargement of the Hall, which was found to be inadequate; and in the year 1411 a new building was commenced." (

- Unfortunately, Baddeley's lively style becomes superdry as soon as he starts describing the place (that's because he is simply quoting ginormous passages from Prince).

- _Gogmagog_ and _Corineus_: today we have two wooden statues of these giagantic figures, but they simply try to mirror "Their predecessors, in days gone by, used to be carried in the processional pageant on Lord Mayor's Day. It is presumed that they were intended to represent Gogmagog and Corneus who, in the mythical chronicles of the monks of the middle ages, are represented as fighting the battles of the Trojan invaders against the early inhabitants of this island. [This is our old friend __Geoffrey of Monmouth__, BTW and FYI.] This myth fostered the belief that these figures preserve to the present day - the tradition that our City was founded by the invader, and that London, as stately "Troynovaunt," or New Troy, was the principal city of Albion, a thousand years before the Christian Era." (67-68)

	- From Thomas Boreham: "Before the present giants inhabited Guildhall there were two giants, made only of wicker-work and pasteboard, put together with great art and ingenuity, and these two terrible, original giants had the honour to yearly grace My Lord Mayor's Show, being carried in great triumph in the time of the pageants; and when that eminent annual service was over, remounted their old stations in Guildhall, till, by reason of their very great age, Old Time with the help of the City rats and mice had eaten up all their entrails." (quot on p. 68)

- A common hall, as mentioned in different parts of this book, may be briefly described as an assembly of the various "Livery Companies" of the City. In addition to the Common Hall on Midsummer Day, for electing Sheriffs, and that on Michaelmas Day for the election of Lord Mayor, Common Halls are also held in the Guildhall in times of trouble and discontent, when the opinions of the citizens require to be expressed." (70)

- Erection of the __council chamber__ "a convenient place to be had for erection of a faire Councell Chamber for the Lord Maior and his bretheren the Aldermen, and the learned Councell and officers of this Cittye to meet in; and for the enlargement of the Threasorye for keeping the Cittyes Cheres, and Records" (78) [this is beginning of s. XVII]

- __The Aldermen's Court Room__ is "certainly the most sumptuously decorated and attractive apartment in the Guildhall. The room itself was probably built in the early part of the 17th century [...]." __possible__ to point out that the Guildhall was extremely active at the time; it was constantly expanding, after Stow; past was not a stable place, it was a dynamic base for the prosperous present of the city.

- The __LIBRARY__; something on which you could spend some time. Activated in __1425__; "a separate structure, situated on the south side of the Guildhall Chapel" (96); "described in a schedule of possessions of the Guildhall College, dated 24th July, 1549, 3 Edward VI., "as a certen house nexte unto the sam Chapell apperteynyng called the Library, all waies res'ved for students to resorte unto, wt three chambres under nithe the saide library, which library being covered wt Slate is valued together wt the Chambers at xiijs, iiijd. yearly." From the same document we learn that "the saied library is a house appointed by the saied Maior and cominalitie for [...] resorte of all students for their education in Divine Scriptures."

- Baddeley can be followed closely here, especially when he quotes the immortal words of John Stow, being - predictably - a pedantic wuss: "Adioyning to this chapell on south side was sometimes a fayre and large librarie, furnished with nookes, pertaining to the Guildhall and colledge: these bookes (as it is said) were in the raigne of Edward the 6 sent for by Edward, duke of Sommerset, Lord Protector, with promise to be restored shortly: men laded from thence three Carriers with them, but neuer returned. This librarie was builded by the executors of R. Whitington, and by William Burie: the arms of Whitington are placed on one side in the stone worke, and two letters, to wit, W and B for William Burie, on the other side: it is now lofted through, and made a store house for clothes." (97) [This had happened during the year __1550__; please notice that, in any case, Stow seems to have been using at least _a_ library belonging to the _Guildhall_; probably its archive." (97)

- __EASTERN CRYPT__ (another thing we won't do without) "of the same date as the Great Hall above it (1411) and occupies rather more than half its basement. It is considered to be the finest and most extensive under-crypt in London. [...] At the intersection and points of the ribs an interesting series of carved bosses, 10 inches diameter, is introduced. Those in the centre of the groins being large roses, 21 inches diameter, bearing shields which are charged with the arms assigned to King Edward the Confessor" (111)

-__Western Crypt__ this is most probably the crypt of the ancient Guildhall, which Stow says extended towards Aldermanbury - it is now impossible to accurately determine the construction of this crypt, as probably the great fire of 1666 so damaged the vaulting that it was found desirable to remove it" (113)

- The history of Guildhall is of course deeply intertwined with the history of the city; and the _ab ovo_ initially established by _Baddeley_ returns in the section devoted to the actual functioning of the institution (equivalent to the building). A mayor started to exist in 1189. "The commonly received opinion, however, is that a change in the name of the Chief Magistrate of the City was made at the accession of Richard I. (1189). In a record preserved among the archives of the City it is stated: "In the same year (1 Richard I.), Henry Fitz-Eylwin, of Londenestane, was made Mayor of London, and was the first Mayor of the City, and continued to be such Mayor to the end of his life." [...] In 1215, John granted to the citizens the right to elect, annually, their own Mayor." (114)

- The day of the election changed often, until "the year 1546" it settled on the day of "Michaelmas Day".

- __Election__ of the Mayor. Until 1376 the Mayor for the time being was elected by the Alderman and Sheriffs conjointly with the "whole commonalty." or with a deputation from the various Wards. In that year and ordinance was passed transferring the right of election to members selected by the rulers of the Guilds, their number varying according to the status of each Guild. [...] In 1467 the Guilds were again to the fore, the election being ordered to be made by the __Common Council__, the Master and Wardens of each mystery coming in their livery, and by "other good men specially summoned;" and the Livery continued to play an important part in each election until 1651 [...] much __friction__ continued to exist between the __Guilds__ and the __Wards__" (115)

- __PROCESSION__ and __Banquet__ accompanying the proclamation of the new mayor.

- __Insigna__ bestowed upon the Lord Mayor (actually interesting):

	- "a handsome collar of SS. [...] said to be one of the finest as well as the earliest of those known" (128)- manufactured before 1544, and enlarged in 1567;
	
	- "the city sceptre" or "ancient Mace"; its date "unknown,"but "whilst the head appears to be of the 15th century, the shaft may possibly date back to Saxon times;"

	- "four swords," of which the first - "the "Pearl" Sword" has been presented by Queen Elizabeth when she openend the first Royal Exchange in 1571 - other two weere first used "in 1534" and "1563" (129-130);

- What we can __remark__ here is that this is the site of both a preservation and a construction of a past, depending on a complex network of __ritual practices__. Many of these objects began to be used in Early Modern times, but they are said to possess a much older story - here and probably in those very days.

- The __two Sheriffs__ were also elected in the Guildhall - one by the "Mayor, Aldermen, and the "Good Men" of the City, or "Commonalty,"" and the other "by the Mayor" (140).

- __COURTS__ and the _administration_ of the City (Institutions).

- The __Court of Aldermen__ "In early times the Aldermen seem to have had a kind of proprietary right over their Wards, arising no doubt from the fact that many of them were territorial magnates, this would probably account for the singularly irregular boundaries of many of the City Wards." (154) "From 1377, however, each Ward annually elected its own Alderman, after which, the Aldermen for the time being retained their office for life, unless removed therefrom for some reasonable and justifiable cause; and this rule continues to the present day." (154-155).

- The __Court of Common Council__: "the names of the good men of all the Wards sworn to consult with the Aldermen on the affairs of the City of London." [...] "the election had been reverted to the inhabitants of the Wards, being Freemen, each Ward electing representatives as before in proportion to its size."

- The final section of __Baddeley__ is a series of good deeds enacted by the institutions inhabiting the Guildhall. This is no joke, even in Early Modern times: the community of the Guilds - the Aldermen and the men of the Common Council - had both the influence and the wealth to support the city and its people through construction, renovation, and work. It is arguable that no other power in the city - yes, it is almost undoubtable - had the same opportunities: it was a coincidence of money and power that granted this group the chance of changing things."

##From __Barron__

"There have been two schools of thought about this. The antiquary John Stow, followed by the City Surveyor earlier in this century, Sydney Perks, believed that the early Guildhall had been built upon a site separate from that on which Guildhall now stands, lying between Aldermanbury and the present Guildhall. The other school of thought which has been supported by John Price in his detailed _Descriptive account of the Guildhall of the City of London_ published in 1886 and, more recently, by Mr. Philip Jones [...], believes that the present Guildhall was constructed in the fifteenth century upon the site of the earlier Guildhall." (15)

- A __MYSTERY__: Barron juxtaposes two quotation from Stow, and therefore shows that "These two accounts of the building of Guildhall in the fifteenth century to be found in Stow are __inconsistent__." (16)

- She goes on to say that "Robert Fabyan's _New Chronicles of England and France_ which appeared first in 1516 and were used by Stow, are quite explicit that what happened in the fifteenth century was that Guildhall was enlarged and extended on its existing site." (16)

##From __Foxe__

- A whole section in the trial of Anne Askew is named "The summe of the condemnation of me Anne Askew at the Guildhall."

- Same for Cranmer: 

> "After this, in the moneth of Nouemb. the Archbyshop Cranmer (notwithstāding he had earnestly refused to subscribe to the kings wil, in disheriting his sister Marye, alledging many graue and pithy reasons for her legitimation, was in Guild hall of London arraigned and attainted of treason, with the L. Iane, and three of the Duke of Northumberlandes sonnes, which at the intreatye of certayne persons were had againe to the Tower, and there kept for a time."

- The episode is preceded by "The Oration of Queene Marie in the Guild Hall."

- We have some trouble understanding the juridical status of this institution at the moment. What is this place? Why does Queen Mary need to speak there in order to obtain the arrest of Cranmer and Marye?

- The GH as the __interface__ between the _City_ and the monarchy, and between the _City_ and the world.

- Here is something fun "you know, for kids":

> There was seene two Sunnes both shining at once, the one a good prety way distaunt from the other. At the same time was also seene a Rainebowe turned contrary, and a great deale higher then hath bene accustomed. The common standinge of the Raynebowe is thus ⁀ but thys stoode thus ‿ with the heade downward, and the feete as it were vpwarde. Both these sightes were sene, as wel at Westminster, in Cheapeside, on the Southside of Paules, as in very many other places, and that by a great number of honest men. Also certaine Aldermen went out of the Guild Hall to beholde the sight.

> As touching the rising of master Wyate, with Syr W. Cobham and others in Kent, and there comming to London in the moneth of Februarie: also of the Queenes comming to the Guilde Hall, and her Oration there made: and after of the taking of the said Wyat and his company: likewise of the apprehension of the Duke of Suffolke with his brother Lord Iohn Gray: and the next day  after of beheading of Lord Gildford and Lady Iane, which was the 12. day of February, and how the day before, which was 11. of the sayd moneth, Lord William Haward and sir Edwarde Hastings, were sent for the Ladie Elizabeth

> Vpon the Saterday, beeing the xxviij. of Aprill, 

> Syr Iames Croft, and Maister Winter were agayne brought to the Guild hall, where Sir Iames Croft was arraigned and condemned, and because the day was farre spent, Maister Winter was not arraigned.

> Vpon the Thursday, being the xvij. of May, 

> William Thomas was arraigned at the Guild Hall, and there the same day condemned, who the next day after, was hanged, drawne, and quartered. His accusation was, for cōspiring the Queenes death: which how true it was, I haue not to say.  This is certaine, that he made a right godly ende, and wrote many fruitefull exhortations, Letters and Sonets in the prison before his death.

> Here is to be noted, that at the comming of Queene Mary to the Guild hall, being bruted before that shee was comming wt harnessed men, such a feare came among them that a number of the Londiners fearing least they shoulde be there intrapped & put to death, made out of the gate before her entring in. Furthermore note, that when shee had ended her Oration (which she semed to haue perfectly conned without booke) Winchester standing by her, when the Oration was done, with great admiration cried to þe people: O how happy are we, to whom God hath geuen such a wise and learned Prince. &c.

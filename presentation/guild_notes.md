#From __Richard III__

> _GLOUCESTER_ Go, after, after, cousing Buckingham.  
> The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in a post.  
> There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,  
> Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.  
> Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen  
> Only for saying he would make his son  
> Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,  
> Which by the sign thereof was termed so.  
> [...]  
> If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;  
> Where you shall find me well accompanied  
> With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.  
> _BUCKINGHAM_ I go; and towards the three or four o'clock  
> Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.  

##From __Price__

- The book opens with a quotation from Richard III - Guildhall is the place which embodied the past in the eyes of Early Modern Londoners.

- "while there is no public edifice that for so many centuries has been more identified with the fortunes of the City than has its Guildhall, yet there is no existing structure, ecclesiastical or civil, which appears to have received so little attention at the hands of the antiquarian enquirer."

- "we contemplate its connection with the incident chronicled by Shakespeare, with the sometimes turbulent gatherings, or at others, gorgeous pageants of the Middle Ages, the trials of Lady Jane Grey, her ill-fated husband and the aged Cranmer, with other to be noted"

- "with the esception of the information collected by that enthusiastic and ever-to-be-remembered lover of London history, John Stow, there is scarcely anything on record"

- "To fully appreciate the historical interest of the Guildhall and its surroundings, it is necessary to devote a brief consideration to the origin and development of that municipal life which has made the City what it is; and to study a little the history of our country and its capital, at a period not only prior to the investigations of Stow and other writers, but of one long anterior to the existence of the City archives themselves."

##From __Stow__

-  The great description of the history of the Guildhall is in the section devoted to Cheape Ward; here we find a list of the various courts held at the Guildhall, a history of its erection, and a description of its __statues__.

- By the Guildhall a special __college__ was erected; we should understand how connected the two institutions were.

- Guildhall also hosted a __library__. Important stuff; it probably still does.

- (Guildhall as the keeper of the past.)

- In the section about the _sheriffs and mayors of London_, Stow tells the reader how he has "read in books of accounts in the Guildhall;" our old friend was using this library as well. And how could we blame him? This must have been among his favorite places.

- In the section about the _liveries_ we have an interesting digression on a detail of the Guildhall: "more near our time, there yet __remaineth the counterfeits and pictures of aldermen__, and others that lived in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward VI., [_namely alderman Darby dwelling in Fenchurch street, over against the parish church of St. Diones, left his picture, as of an alderman, in a gown of scarlet on his back, a hood in his head, etc., as is in that house (and elsewhere) to be seen:_] for a further monument of those late times, men may behold the glass windows of the mayor's court in the Guildhall above the stairs, the mayor is there pictured sitting in habit, party-coloured, and a hood on his head, his swordbearer before him with a hat or cap of maintenance: the common clerk, and other officers bare-headed, their hoods on their shoulders; and therefore I take it, that the use of square bonnets worn by noblemen, gentlemen, citizens, and others, took beginning in this realm by Henry VII. and in his time, and of further antiquity, I can see no counterfeit or other proof."

	- _What is noticeable here_ is the fact that Stow is __reading__ the very building; Stow is looking at the building in order to discover details related to the City's past customs.

##From __Baddeley__

- First crucial piece of information: towards the end of the __XIX__ century, Guildhall started collecting and compiling _pieces of its own past_.

- The _ab ovo_ of Baddeley is the aftermath of the Norman conquest; he pictures Coeur-de-Lion's "martial figure striding at times through the Hall" (8).

- This seems to be the space where the __mediation__ between the City and its rulers takes place; this is the house of __the citizens__; Baddeley stages here the "wrestling" of the Magna Carta from the reluctant John (1215).

	- In fact, this is precisely how __Shakespeare__ understands the place in _Richard III_.

- The building is also the __center__ of Medieval London.

- In the brief survey of the hall's history by Beddeley, a __table__ seems to possess an unusual importance.

- "Yet, at the same period, in this same Guildhall of ours, we are pleased to picture grave citizens pacing the floor, full of pious schemes for the advancement of learning, which resulted in the establishment of the world-famed schools of the Mercers, St. Paul's, the Merchant Taylors, and others in the City;"

- This episode contrasts with the trial and burning of Anne Askew (1546).

- The Guildhall is the place where the Reformation takes place. We should have a look at the __Book of Martyrs__: here we have Cranmer and Jane Grey.

- Guildhall as a stage, of course. Early Modern culture of theater as a reaction to the Reformation: the world becomes a stage - forgetful, impotent against change, incapable of influencing history, of retaining history - because history has changed so often; kings have changed so often, their beliefs and allegiances have changed so often.

Drawing from the notion of developing shame with which Paster begins her exploration of feminine leakiness, I would like to address what to me seems the most distinctive staging technique practiced by Thomas Middleton in both _The Chaste Maid_ and _Michaelmas Term_: a negation of private spaces that persistently causes eavesdropping and conversational intrusion. Compared with Heywood's skillful, often explicitly geometrical, spatialization of the setting, with its suggestive symmetries and contrasts, Middleton's distribution of bodies and objects on the stage is often deliberately chaotic. The characters enter and leave the stage almost accidentally, at times without a specific purpose, establishing temporary groups that occasionally challenge our understanding of

__visual attention - visual focus__ (they enter our visual scope - frame; they enter each other's visual frame; as spectators, we are forced to focus our attention __on one part of the stage__; we are forced to ignore part of what is happening, and to focus only on what is happening - education of our vision?)

__neighborliness__

 __privacy__

__credit__: education about __being heard__

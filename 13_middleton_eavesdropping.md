#Trained Neighborliness
Drawing from the idea of developing shame, with which Paster begins her exploration of feminine leakiness, I would like to address what, to me, seems the most distinctive staging technique practiced by Middleton in both _The Chaste Maid_ and _Michaelmas Term_: a persistent negation of privacy, which results in constant eavesdropping and conversational invasion. The reason is spatial: compared with Heywood's skillful, often geometrical, organization of the setting, with its suggestive symmetries and contrasts, Middleton's distribution of bodies and objects on the stage is deliberately chaotic. Always engaged in multiple conversations, his characters enter and leave the stage almost accidentally, without a specific purpose, gathering in groups and pairs that occasionally challenge our understanding of acquaintances, allegiances, and class structures. This convention produces two effects: on the one hand, as spectators, we are given the impression that these interactions are casual, and that they occur within the boundaries of our visual scope only by chance, like customary, unimportant urban encounters; on the other, we are compelled to focus only on one portion of the stage, supposedly the one which is sonically active, and to ignore what is happening elsewhere. By linking sight to sound, we create our perception of background and foreground, and we learn how to privilege specific individuals and circumstances over others; this is a training that we share with the characters on stage, who, according to their awareness of neighboring eyes and ears, are constantly either spying or being spied on. Finally, the casual or calculated proximity produced by these flexible urban neighborhoods, where privacy is progressively threatened, suggests that we should educate not only our senses, but also our always potentially public appearance and speech. How is the strategic production of a visible and audible self related to the cardinal notion of social "credit"?

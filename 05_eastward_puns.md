#Terrifying Puns
Like metaphors, sexual puns are transfers of meaning: despite their immediate lexical context, the expressions that the reader would most expect are replaced by expressions (or acceptations) drawn from different fields, on the basis of a contiguity in either form (homophony) or content (polysemy, innuendo). Like in metaphors, the sexual element can coincide with either the _tenor_ (the original lexical context) or with the _vehicle_ (the field of the intruding meaning). In the puns of __Westward Ho__, sex is the _vehicle_: it penetrates a foreign discourse, in several occasions concerning a refined human activity, in order to cheerfully subvert its customary implications. Obvious examples are the two prolonged sequences concerning the holding of the "pen" (2.1) and the playing of the "instrument" (5.3): operating a predictable sexualization of materiality, based on conventional – phallic – imagery, the pun works as an instrument of seduction, a playful stripping of language and convention. Through its concealment and sudden disclosure, regardless of its fulfillment or frustration, sex becomes the desired end of the performance. On the other hand, in the puns of __Eastward Ho__, sex tends to be the _tenor_: a primarily sexual discourse is therefore disrupted by the intrusion of a strange element, often bestial or mundane. We find instances of this move in the central dialogue between Gertrude and her mother (3.2), or in Quicksilver’s witty remarks (2.3): sex is turned into a swelling “prick,” a mouse’s “tail,” the torment of a “dog” bound to a “wheel.” The effect of these transfers is repulsive and debasing; in Petronel’s words, the anticipation of sex becomes “terrif[_ying_]” (2.3.69). How can we relate this difference to the overall development of the two plays, and perhaps to “the ability to transform the materials of dominant culture into the symbols of subversion” (4) described by Bailey?

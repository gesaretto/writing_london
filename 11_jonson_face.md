#London's Masked _Face_
The first altercation involving _Subtle_ and _Face_, in scene 1.1 of _The Alchemist_, concerns an apparently indeterminable hierarchy of responsibility. Before their fortunate (or fatal) meeting, "time's not long past" (15), the two characters were living in very different conditions: _Face_ was "the good, | Honest, plain, livery-three-pound-thrum," in charge of keeping his "master's worship's house [...] | For the vacations" (15-18), while _Subtle_ was a wanderer, arrayed like a beggar, and without means of sustenance. This quarrel reaches its climax when _Face_ reminds his partner that the "house" where the alchemist practices his "black arts" was actually "lent" to him (45-47): _Subtle_ replies that, first, the house does not belong to _Face_, but to his master (49), and that, in any case, without his "words and fashion" (73), synecdochically rendered as "clothes" (63), the "place" would only be good for "cobwebs" (56), "rats" (50), and "spider[_s_]" (66). _Face_ is therefore initially assimilated to the "vermin" (64) left behind by the devastation of the plague, and afterwards to the very architectural skeleton of the deserted building: the time that he has spent alone within "The empty walls" (5.5.39) of _Lovewit_'s residence has made him indistinguishable from them. Regardless of his current owner, the "house" can always be "clothed" anew, dressed and re-dressed indefinitely through the - occasionally esoteric - "words and fashion" of multiple rhetorical discourses, exemplified by the several masks and disguises worn by _Face_ through the development of the plot. The initial contrast between the host and the guest, the abandoned house(keeper) and the smoke and talk brought in by the alchemist, is eventually resolved in favor of the former: given his mutability, _Face_ proves his supremacy over _Subtle_. Can we compare these changeable yet permanent walls, exploiting their transients, to those of the city?

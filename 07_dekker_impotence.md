#Impotent Labor

As she argues for the exuberant masculinity of Simon Eyre and his followers, opposed, in the "whitewashed fantasy" (56) of _The Shoemaker's Holiday_, to the feminized apparel and manners of the aristocracy, Ronda Arab offers an interpretation of Ralph's lameness that, like the character himself, seems at least limping. Ralph and Jane's romance mirrors that of Lacy and Rose: temporarily separated from their beloveds, and threatened by Hammond's sneaky seductions, the two journeymen  are parallelly rewarded in the end, thus sanctioning the artisans' well-deserved celebration. Together with the deceiving character of Hans, Ralph is one of the two pillars of the play, allegedly a model for the virtues of labor. And yet his physical brokenness does not seem to affect Arab's thesis in any way: although "Ralph's wounded body [...] is neither complete nor self-sufficient," its inclusion within the efficient organism of the Guild would still allow him to be presented as an example of "true masculinity" (55). I find this claim highly debatable - so much as to hinder the entirety of Arab's understanding of the play. Despite the jolly suggestiveness of the praises that first commend his departure for the war ("prick thine enemies," 1.191), Ralph immediately seems to soak in the "puling, [...] blubbering" impotence of Jane's "wet eyes" (1.117): before his reappearance in the second half of the play he utters a total of seventeen lines, all of which could probably be summarized in the submissive resignation of his first "Yes, sir" (1.184), a dysillabic assent metrically clasped - in an _antilabe_ - by Lacey's interrogation and command. But if conscripted Ralph might simply be quiet, veteran Ralph seems plain "impotent" (10.71): despite Margery's equivocal observation does not reach "a little higher" (10.74), manliness does never truly counterbalance the journeyman's "want [of] limbs" (10.86-118).

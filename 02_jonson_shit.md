#Atomic Shit

What do we make of the juxtaposition of _Democrite_ and _Pythagoras_ in the second section of Ben Jonson's __Epigram CXXXIII__ (Dantesque - even over-Dantesque - number, by the way)? The colorful ghosts brooding over the bank of the Fleet, in fact the "farts [...] departed" from the effervescent intestines of "the _Masters_" squatting above them, are assembled into "thicke frequent mists," natural phenomena that progressively lose the distinguishable "formes" of their original bearers. The transition from one state to the other is introduced by a reference to "all those _Atomi_ ridiculous" of which, according to the Greek philosopher, "the world consists." This reference may appear abrupt, inconsistent, or an additional parodying touch, with which the poet would be willing to include science among the objects of his satire. If we were to follow the trail of these atoms, however, we would soon learn that, from their present vaporous state, "tr[_ying_] the un-used value of [_our_] nose," they turn into the elements that pervade every corner of the scene: "the wall," "the jakes," and "the flakes" seen floating through the stream, "All [...] the same." Their cycle becomes one with the swift progression of the lines, which then turns to the "hogs, [...] dogs," and "Cats," captured, flayed and "rosted" once and again by the "cookes" of the "_Fleet_-lane:" these animal creatures live through a parallel cycle, which ends, however, into the same boiling liquid, "in with the melted pewter." We could easily close the atomic and animal cycle at this point, and at the same time: together with their discarded bodies, their "heads, houghs, entrailes, and the hides" become part of the same environment, therefore feeding their living counterparts - human and nonhuman. _Pythagoras_ joins _Democrites_: atomic metempsychosis allows the dead cat to mew with a human voice.

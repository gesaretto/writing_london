#Notes on the _Famous Voyage_

##Work schedule for April 30th

- __Structure__:

	1. __Section I__: the river (or the city?) 

		1. The Fleet;
	
		2. Ecosystem;

		3. Corrupt cycle in the poem
	
			1. __Waste is shit__

			2. __the body of the city__

				- Yes, I probably need to spend some time on the body of the city, on the city as a human body. Because that was my way of talking about the extraordinary idea that is at the core of _FV_: coprophagy. Coprophagy is how I end this section.

			3. McRae: open with the ass, finish with the mouth

			4. We eat shit.

				- So, in short, not hard: __body of the city__; __inversion__ in McRae__; __coprophagy__.

	2. __Section II__: the poem (or the text?)

		6. The horror of coprophagy (coprophagia) as a violation of pollution; Mary Douglas from _pollution_ to _impurity_.

			- I introduce Douglas only at the end of this section, to turn __pollution__ (ecological, physical, environmental) into __impurity__ (religious, theological, social). _The Famous Voyage_ also works on the ambiguity between environmental impurity and mental impurity. This is a simple, but powerful concept. Impurity of the place where you live is impurity of the mind that you use. 

		7. [__Very delicate move.__] From Mary Douglas to Kristeva: from impurity, to the dissolution of boundaries, to _abjection_, to the fall from the symbolic order into __the Real__. This has to be subtle - just enough to introduce the dissolution of language.

		8. __Poetaster__ and the ambivalence of this lost boundary: language is an object.

		9. The __purge__ of _Famous Voyage_.

	10. __Section III__: the age

		10. __Some sort of conclusion__ for the previous section. Perhaps this would instead be the right time to introduce _Kristeva_?

		11. Cultural waste: getting rid of _religion_ and _epic_; the _epic_ of the previous section becomes the _religion_ of this section.

		12. The _discard_ (ejection, expulsion...) is based on two ideas:

			1. the fusion between language and matter;

			2.  the corrupt ecosystem that ends up by assimilating its own waste.

		13. Close readings:

			1. Mercury and the pills;

			2. The atoms and metempsychosis.

		14. The cause for this degradation is the market.

		15. __Conclusion__: Ben Jonson just feels guilty.

##Revision (April 2015)

- __Goals__:

	- get rid of the useess quotations - references - ideas: __simplify__;

	- work on the weak points of the first section:
		
		1. _adventurers_ and _everyday experience_ - a very stupid contradiction there;
		1. the _scolds_ and the _furies_: no need to talk about "process of commodity evaluation";
		1. think about the grounds on which the transaction is enacted: "new" and "true" are deceptive [problematic?] categories;
		1. "exchanging" loads is not the same as "discharging" loads (more should be done with the __vocabulary__ there;
		1. __feminine rhyme__ with Hercules and the rest.

##Reading of April 26th

1. From epigram to epic; the change in genre of the first few lines is a transition into a _narrative_ domain; the characters that we have encountered in the book (e.g., _Shelton_) will be the characters of an epic adventure.

	1. The tone is probably _suspended_ between the encomiastic (celebratory) and the mockery.

2. Not irrelevant: the name __Fleet__ does not appear immediately; it is, in fact, quite hard to understand what the poet is referring to at the beginning. There is a sort of poetical ambiguity about those lines.

	1. Although, as we want to say, the real protagonist _is_ the Fleet Ditch: it is the __one__ element whose pollution surpasses every antique analog (see first few lines). It is referred to, but not _named_, in the first few lines.

3. The exchange generates __confusion__ (between the material and the immaterial; between the input and the output; between the preserved and the discarded). Confusion is the word that Jonson uses here to define, in fact, _pollution_: the inextricable mixture of _filth, stench, noyse_.

	1. Commerce generates confusion.

4. From denial to substitution - from __no__ to __in stead__ (we introduce substitution only in the third part of our paper).

5. What is Ben Jonson's actual position in the play? __Our impression is that__ he differentiates himself from the _Poets_ of the past, and instead equates his work to the feats of the contemporary wager travellers (journeymen).

6. The first exact topographical definition is on line __41__; follow the poet's forgetfulness and the invocation to the muses.

	1. Why is the Fleet connected to the forgetfulness of the poet and to the invocation to the Muses? We know the reason: because this is the _flowing back_ of epic.

7. Looking at the actual invocation, which we use to define the recursive motion of waste, flowing back to the person who had discarded it, we are also struck by a general sense of _fixity_. This is, in any case, a __repetition__ of the opening; an improvement on the opening, perhaps - but still working in quite the same way.

	- So, remember to use more than just the _flowing back_ of referents in the part devoted to the _poem_ - talk about encroachments and blockages - soilage.

8. We use _Alcides_ (or we _can_ use _Alcides_) in the introductory part of section 3 (the city; science and religion); it is an instance of actual _confusion_ between material (human) and immaterial (divine).

9. We use the following section to talk about the reversed body which McRae describes so well (the wombe, the unloading). This is the _lower end_ of this grotesque body: at the same time sphincter and sex.

10. We do not do much with the section that immediately follows (67-92); although it could probably be used to describe the critical pollution of the ditch (filth, disease, misery). The author noticeably starts by describing consequences, not causes, of this degradation: the butthole of the waterway is its impoverished, rotten condition; the mouth is the association of commercial enterprises that cause the same degradation.

11. Mercury is at line 93 and following; we still feel like a close-reading of this might be useful; in any case, the attention is on materiality (the pills) as opposed to religion, culture and spirituality (eloquence? divinity?). Note how Mercurius has some direct speech from line 103 to line 111 - and he mentions _himself_ in his own speech; after that a new section begins.

12. Religion in fact explictly enters the imaginary landscape of the poem before the _Atomi_ and _Pythagoras_, when the people shitting in the privies are described as worshippers (121-124).

13. Then we have the ghosts, and the _Atomi_ ridiculous. Again, there is a lot to be done here. Some old fashioned close-reading will help. For the moment, note the progression from __ghosts__ to __farts__; they are then _compared_ to the _Atomi_ ridiculous of old _Democrite_ and _Hill Nicholas_. Again, this passage deserves some careful meditation.

	1. The farts-ghosts-atomi then become "thick frequent mists," and part of the environment (or ecosystem) of the Fleet).

14. Between the end of this section and the following one (~136-154) we have a section that is crucial for the discourse about the _ecosystem_: it is the moment when the cooks are described as they prepare the food that will be eaten in the Fleet; and this follows the nasal penetration of atoms into the bodies of the travellers - the travellers are absorbing shit through their nostrils in the same way as the people who live on the banks ingest shit in their food. The _materialism_ of this section allows us to place it in the first section (the river - or the ditch).

15. Also, we have a description of what the work of butchers, tanners and cooks looks like (we use it at the beginning, to talk about the corrupt cycle of the ditch; and at the end, to talk about Ben Jonson's profession and editorial practices).

16. Follows the section on _Pythagoras_ (155). This is, in a way, an inversion of what was happening with _Mercurius_: there we had a progression from the _immaterial_ (religious) to the _material_ (medicinal); here we have one from science (atoms) to religion (metempsychosis). There is another direct speech - and we question the actual provenience of the previous speech: was the ejected _Mercurius_ speaking?

17. The ending - not much to say: it is simply unsatisfactory and vague - contributing to the general feeling of _occlusion_.

- - -

- __The poem__:

	- creates an ecosystem by isolating items and by defining a boundary - what is protected, what is valued, what is preserved, kept, and purchased - and what is not (the discarded);

	- equates this internal ecosystem with two external ecosystems: the __book__ (and _the city as a book_) and the __body of the city__;

	- describes and denounces the pollution / contamination / confusion that is perceivable across these ecosystems.

- - -

- _Ecosystem and waste as_ referring to _a line between what is useful and what is not. Production of waste. Waste as dependent on the separation between what is preserved (what is desired, what is bought,_ purchased? _) and what is discarded._
	
	1. Discarding and pollution (contamination?) in the __BODY__;
	2. Discarding and pollution (contamination?) in the __BOOK__.

- Mixture between the two levels - the physical (bodily) and the spiritual (intellectual).

	- Conclusion as an indictment against (_early modern?_) culture.

	- _Science becoming religion._

- __CXXXIII__ as the __margin__ of the poem; it produces an _expulsion_ from its very beginning.

- The two main concerns of the _epigrams_ as a collection being precisely __the book__ (the literary system or ecosystem) and the __city__.

	- We could add a general reminder about how the _material production_ (_circulation?_) of the book is already __pushing against__ (resisting) the sharp (possibly sharp) dichotomy between the world of ideas and the world of the body.

	- The collection of __Epigrams__ as an ecosystem with the __Voyage__ just at its limits.

- - -

##The Epigrams

- They were ready to be issued in __1612__ (11 years after _Poetaster_; the idea is the same, only emphasized in a grotesque manner - not a gush of vomit, but a whole river of shit). 

- The _epigrams_ as a book of _enigmata_.

- The __epigrams__ as the _opposite_ of __epic__.

	- __Virgil__ and __Horace__ are already juxtaposed in _Poetaster_. Aren't they?

- Is there a development in the presentation of some __city types__?

- Is there __epic__ in the epigrams? (Our immediate answer is __no__. We have classical referencese in the _epigrams_, but __no__ epic.)

- - -

- The epigrams as a laboratory of urban observations. How do we look at these types? How are they displayed / understood / presented? How do they __interact__? How do they possiblu develop? Where are they found? How do we find them?

	- There is an obvious focus on __appearances__ throughout the collection.

	- The descriptions of the __literary types__ construct a social identity and describe their __appearance__ within a __public sphere__ of _shared exposition_ - mutual exposure and observation. Just like that of the urban and the courtly types described elsewhere.

	- Abstract __literary__ ideas are treated as materially determined commodities.

	- The epigrams seem to place a lot of value in the __act of naming__.

		- People who are criticized are tipified (they bear allegorical, mocking names);
		
		- People who are celebrated are __named__.

- - - 

- _The most threatening idea of the poem is the idea of losing the boundary, of missing the boundary, of being no longer able of telling the difference between the dead flakes of skin that are leaving my body, and my very body._
	
	- This is why __Kristeva__ is still useful.

- The two leading images: __the city as a human body__ and __the city as a book__.

- Conflation of the __material__ and the __immaterial__ in the _confusion_ of the __Thames__.

	- _Confusion_ as the blurring of boundaries that creates abjection (__Kristeva__). Necessary scatology.

	- _Shit being eaten_ is the reason for which the poem eventually becomes profoundly disgusting.

- __A very important question__: why are we not doing anything with the __ending__?

- - -

##Poetaster

1. In scene 3 of act 5 __Crispinus__ is seen _vomiting words_.

> __Caesar__. Here be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man's ears.  
> __Horace__. Ay. Please it great Caesar, I have pills about me,  
> Mixed with the whitest kind of hellebore,  
> Would give him a light vomit that should purge  
> His brain and stomach of those tumultous heats  
> Might I have leave to minister unto him.  
> __Caesar__. O be his Aesculapius, gentle Horace;  
> You shall have leave, and he shall be your patient.  
> Virgil, use your authority, command him forth.  
> __Virgil__. Caesar is careful of your health, Crispinus,  
> And hath himself chose a physician  
> To minister unto you: take his pills.  
> __Horace__. [_Giving Crispinus a pill_] They are somewhat bitter,  
> sir, but very wholesome.  
> Take yet another, so. Stand by, they'll work anon.  
> __Tibullus__. Romans, return to your several seats. Lictors, bring forward the urn and set the accused at the bar.  
> [...]  
> __Crispinus__. [_Groaning_] O---  
> __Tibullus__. How now, Crispinus?  
> __Crispinus__. O, I am sick---  
> __Horace__. A basin, a basin, quickly; our physic works. [_To Crispinus_] Faint not, man.  
> [HORACE _holds a basin into which_ CRISPINUS _appears to vomit his words._]  
> __Crispinus__. O --- _retrograde_ --- _reciprocal_ --- _incubus_.  
> __Caesar__. What's that Horace?  
> __Horace__. [_Looking in the basin_] _Retrograde_, _reciprocal_ and _incubus_ are come up.  
> [...]  
> __Tibullus__. O Jupiter!  
> __Gallus__. Who would have thought there should ha' been such a deal of filth in a poet?  
> [...]  
> __Horace__. _Barmy froth_, _puffy_, _inflate_, _turgidous_ and _ventositous_ are come up.  
> __Tibullus__. O terrible windy words!  
> __Gallus__. A sign of a windy brain.  
> [...]  
> __Caesar__. Now all's come up, I trow. What a tumult he had in his belly!  
> [...]  
> __Horace.__ Force yourself then a little with your finger.  
> [CRISPINUS _pushes his finger down his throat._]  
> __Crispinus__. [_Loudly_] O -- O -- _prorumped_.  
> __Tibullus__. _Prorumped?_ What a noise it made! As if his spirit would have prorumped with it.  
> [...]  
> __Caesar__. _Clutched_? It's well that's come up! It had but a narrow passage.  
> [...]  
> __Virgil__. These pills can but restore him for a time,  
> Not cure him quite of such a malady  
> Caught by so many surfeits, which have filled  
> His blood and brain thus full of crudities.  
> 'Tis necessary therefore he observe  
> A strict and wholesome diet. [...]  

- Virgil then proceeds to describe a detailed diet that would __substitute__ the cultural products currently ingested by Crispinus. There is a definite analogy with what is happening in _FV_.

	- The date of composition is __spring or summer 1601__.

- The body is seen convulsing, trembling, melting into an ocean of vomit and farts. Crispinus' body is gushing forth the Fleet Street from both its mouth and its rectum (two-way).

- Another canonically disgusting scene in the wonderful BJ.

1. Similarly _classical_ context.

- - -

##The poem

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  

- [__Still not addressed__] On this note, it would be interesting to look at the function of _italics_ in this poem; was this typographical device a choice of the poet? Or an editorial intervention that we could impute to the printer? Also, how do these _italics_ work? Not only have we proper names of both mythical and historical - contemporary - figures; we have toponyms and place names. _Troyes_ and _hell_. Why is this equivalence set? Is this a feature that we could relate to our idea of London as an organism?

- We emphasized this notion a lot, the notion of falsity; and yet it still sounds unconvincing. Why? What can we do to improve it, to work on it?

	- Reject it because it is __false__; JH talks about _scare quotes_ as the ideological posture that ought to be used whenever I am addressing such culturally defined notions. That is - I should talk about how this move - __exclusion__ - is the move through which Jonson defines everything that is placed outside that boundary as false.

	- And the very notion of __boundary__ should deserve more attention. This is the creation of a cultural domain that is based on __exclusion__. Exclusion defines the inclusion, defines the boundary itself. We are everything that is not included here.

	- __Domain of a city__.

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  

- The prepositional adverb __save__ is possibly the element that should be further emphasized.

- __Confusion__: confusion of identity, confusion of culture, confusion of a mixed body. Threat of a mixed body; threat of a mixed body becoming its own shit.

- The contrast set between __here__ and __there__ is the contrast between the two sides of the boundary.

	- Something should be said - could be said, ought to be said - about the Fleet as a sort of boundary, therefore. The line that divides the body from the skin. __Skinning__ the boars

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> And, for the cryes of _Ghosts_, women, and men  
> Laden with plague-sores, and their sinnes, were heard,  
> Lash'd by their consciences, to die, affeard.  

- Fix the currency problem.

- Inspect the boundary between __material__ and __immaterial__. Materialism. Materialism is both consummerism and the new science, the science that has gotten rid of religion, the science that can do without religion.

> Then let the former age, with this content her,  
> Shee brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer.  

- Why is he using the _italics_ for the poets?

> __The Voyage It Selfe__

- The title as a boundary. Explanations of its effectiveness have been insufficient so far.

	- We will of course focus on the idea of boundary elsewhere.

> I sing the brave adventure of two wights,  
> And pitty 'tis, I cannot call them knights:  

- Still relevant: _The shit that you write is similar to the shit that you hate; the things you keep closest - the things that you produce, that you put together, that you craft - are similar to the things that you have tried to get rid of. You are your own shit._ Here is the fear of Jonson as a writer - the fear of Jonson as a writer being _contaminated_ by the things that he, as a critic, refuses. I believe that we should think more about the very notion of __ecosystem__.

	- Ecosystem is: Jonson's writing; the poem itself; Jonson's mind; London; the Fleet; London's culture; English culture. All of these systems are being contaminated by their own shit. All of these ecosystems are eating their own shit. __Coprophagic fear__ as the heart of the poem.

	- Defining ecosytems at different levels; defining ecosystems as the primary idea at the core of the poem. Perhaps the structure of the whole thing should be revised: perhaps we should start with the __Fleet__ as the corrupt ecosystem described in the poem, then move onto the additional meanings (the poem itself; Jonson's writing; the city; the city's culture). 

> One was; and he, for brawne, and braine, right able  
> To have beene stiled of King _Arthurs_ table.  

> The other was a squire, of faire degree;  
> But, in the action, greater man than hee:  

> Who gave, to take at his returne from _Hell_,  
> His three for one. Now, lordings, listen well.  

- __Wager__.

>  
> It was the day, what time the powerfull _Moone_  
> Makes the poore _Banck-side_ creature wet it' shoone,  

> In it' owne hall; when these (in worthy scorne  
> Of those, that put on moneyes, on returne  
> From _Venice_, _Paris_, or some in-land passage  
> Of sixe times to, and fro, without embassage,  
> Or him that backward went to _Berwicke_, or which  
> Did dance the famous Morrisse, unto _Norwich_)  
> At _Bread-streets_ Mermaid, having din'd, and merry,  
> Propos'd to goe to _Hol'borne_ in a wherry:  
> A harder tasque, then either his to Bristo',  
> Or his to _Antwerpe_. Therefore, once more, list ho'.  

- __Hazard__. How is it relevant?

>  
> A _Docke_ there is, that called is _Avernus_,  
> Of some _Bride-well_, and may, in time, concerne us  
> All, that are readers: but, me thinkes 'tis od,  
> That all this while I have forgot some _god_,  
> Or _goddesse_ to invoke, to stuffe my verse;  

> And with both bombard-stile, and phrase, rehearse  
> The many perills of this _Port_, and how  
> Sans'helpe of _Sybil_, or a golden bough,  
> Or magick sacrifice, they past along!  
> _Alcides_, be thou succouring to my song.  

- __Material__ and __immaterial__? Age of __materialism__. Making the gods material.

> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  

> Great _Club-fist_, though thy backe, and bones be sore,  

- We are not doing enough with the idea of __mixture__.

> Still, with thy former labours; yet, once more,  
> Act a brave worke, call it thy last adventry:  
> But hold my torch, while I describe the entry  
> To this dire passage. Say, thou stop thy nose:  

- Still nothing done with Hercules and the Augean Stables. We should, again, be more explicit about our purpose and our ideas.

> 'Tis but light paines: Indeede this _Dock's_ no rose.  

- _Negation._ So what?

>  
> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts due cluster,  

- This is actually __not__ the description of a pure discharge; this is the description of something already being restituted to the reader. It is also the mixture between two physical states: solid and gas (atomic).

> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  

> Thorough her wombe they make their famous road,  
> Betweene two walls; where, on one side, to scar men,  
> Were seene your ugly _Centaures_, yee call Car-men,  
> _Gorgonian_ scolds, and _Harpyes_: on the other  
> Hung stench, diseases, and old filth, their mother,  
> With famine, wants, and sorrowes many a dosen,  
> The least of which was to the plague a cosen.  
> But they unfrighted passe, though many a privie  
> Spake to 'hem louder, then the oxe in _Livie_:  
> And many a sinke pour'd out her rage anenst 'hem;  
> But still their valour, and their vertue fenc't hem,  
> And, on they went, like _Castor_ brave, and _Pollux_:  
> Ploughing the mayne. When, see (the worst of all lucks)  
> They met the second Prodigie, would feare a  
> Man, that had never heard of a _Chimaera_.  

- Something should be done about this - the hypothetical man that never heard of a _Chimaera_.

> One said, it was bold _Briareus_, or the beadle,  
> (Who hath the hundred hands when he doth meedle)  
> The other thought it _Hydra_, or the trock  
> Made of the trull, that cut her fathers lock:  

- There is apparently a confusion - a mythological blindness here. Is it intentional?

> But, comming neere, they found it but a liter,  
> So huge, it seem'd, they could by no meanes quite her.  
> Backe cry'd their brace of _Charons_: they cry'd, no,  
> No going backe; on still you rogues, and row.  
> How hight the place? a voyce was heard, _Cocytus_.  
> Row close then slaves. Alas they will beshite us.  
> No matter, stinkards, row. What croaking sound  
> Is this we heare? of frogs? No, guts wind-bound,  
> Over your heads: Well, row. At this a loud  
> Crack did report it selfe, as if a cloud  
> Had burst with storme, and down fell, _ab excelsis_,  
> Poore _Mercury_, crying out on _Paracelsus_,  
> And all his followers, that had so abus'd him:  
> And, in so shitten sort, so long had us'd him:  

- _This is the same notion that we had encountered before: the re-using of culture; culture as an element of consumption._

> For (where he was the god of eloquence,  
> And subtlitie of mettalls) they dispense  
> His spirits, now, in pills, and eeke in potions,  
> Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions.  
> But many Moones there shall not wane (quoth hee)  

- Notice that there are no italics for either __Moone__ or __god__ here. Why?

> (In the meane time, let 'hem imprison mee)  
> But I will speake (and know I shall be heard)  
> Touching this cause, where they will be affeard  
> To answere me. And sure, it was th'intent  
> Of the grave fart, late let in parliament,  
> Had it beene seconded, and not in fume  
> Vanish'd away: as you must all presume  
> Their _Mercury_ did now. But this, the stemme  
> Of the hulke touch'd, and, as by _Polypheme_  
> The slie _Ulysses_ stole in a sheepes-skin,  
> The well-greas'd wherry now had got betweene,  
> And bad her _fare-well sough_, unto the lurden:  
> Never did bottom more betray her burden;  
> The meate-boate of Beares colledge, _Paris-garden_,

> Then all those _Atomi_ ridiculous,  
> Whereof old _Democrite_, and _Hill Nicholas_,  
> One said, the other swore, the world consists.  

- __Atoms__.

> These be the cause of those thicke frequent mists  
> Arising in that place, through which, who goes,  
> Must trie the un-used valour of a nose:  
> And that ours did. For yet, no nare was tainted,

#Notes on the _Famous Voyage_

##Revision (April 2015)

- __Goals__:

	- get rid of the useess quotations - references - ideas: __simplify__;
	- engage more explicitly - carefully with your secondary sources:

		- pick __one__ book or article to be used for the problems of _trade_ and _consumption_;
		- read it - __summarize__ it - understand how to put it in discourse with what you are trying to say;

	- work on the weak points of the first section:
		
		1. _adventurers_ and _everyday experience_ - a very stupid contradiction there;
		1. the _scolds_ and the _furies_: no need to talk about "process of commodity evaluation";
		1. think about the grounds on which the transaction is enacted: "new" and "true" are deceptive [problematic?] categories;
		1. "exchanging" loads is not the same as "discharging" loads (more should be done with the __vocabulary__ there;
		1. __feminine rhyme__ with Hercules and the rest;

	- think about how to make second section work:

		- _religion_ and _science_.

- - -

##Style

- Start by __killing the baby__.

	- __KILL THE BABY.__

- Simply look at how beautifully __EJ__ _lists_ stuff.

- - -

##Ideas so far

- The river - ecosystem __1__;

- The poem - ecosystem __2__.

	- The city and the __book__;

	- The city and the __body__.

- __Margin__; the regulation of __waste__.

- __Religion & Science__: the cultural indictment.

	1. Atomi / Democrite v. __Pythagoras__

- - -

- Names acquire a material (an almost material, almost physical) concreteness:

	- think of all the discarded names in the prologue (proemium);

	- think of the double valence of _Mercury_ (God, metal, and name).

- - -

- __The poem__:

	- creates an ecosystem by isolating items and by defining a boundary - what is protected, what is valued, what is preserved, kept, and purchased - and what is not (the discarded);

	- equates this internal ecosystem with two external ecosystems: the __book__ (and _the city as a book_) and the __body of the city__;

	- describes and denounces the pollution / contamination / confusion that is perceivable across these ecosystems.

- - -

- _Ecosystem and waste as_ referring to _a line between what is useful and what is not. Production of waste. Waste as dependent on the separation between what is preserved (what is desired, what is bought,_ purchased? _) and what is discarded._
	
	1. Discarding and pollution (contamination?) in the __BODY__;
	2. Discarding and pollution (contamination?) in the __BOOK__.

- Mixture between the two levels - the physical (bodily) and the spiritual (intellectual).

	- Conclusion as an indictment against (_early modern?_) culture.

	- _Science becoming religion._

- __CXXXIII__ as the __margin__ of the poem; it produces an _expulsion_ from its very beginning.

- The two main concerns of the _epigrams_ as a collection being precisely __the book__ (the literary system or ecosystem) and the __city__.

	- We could add a general reminder about how the _material production_ (_circulation?_) of the book is already __pushing against__ (resisting) the sharp (possibly sharp) dichotomy between the world of ideas and the world of the body.

	- The collection of __Epigrams__ as an ecosystem with the __Voyage__ just at its limits.

- - -

##The Epigrams

- They were ready to be issued in __1612__ (11 years after _Poetaster_; the idea is the same, only emphasized in a grotesque manner - not a gush of vomit, but a whole river of shit). 

- The _epigrams_ as a book of _enigmata_.

- The __epigrams__ as the _opposite_ of __epic__.

	- __Virgil__ and __Horace__ are already juxtaposed in _Poetaster_. Aren't they?

- Is there a development in the presentation of some __city types__?

- Is there __epic__ in the epigrams? (Our immediate answer is __no__. We have classical referencese in the _epigrams_, but __no__ epic.)

- - - 

- _The most threatening idea of the poem is the idea of losing the boundary, of missing the boundary, of being no longer able of telling the difference between the dead flakes of skin that are leaving my body, and my very body._
	
	- This is why __Kristeva__ is still useful.

- The two leading images: __the city as a human body__ and __the city as a book__.

- Conflation of the __material__ and the __immaterial__ in the _confusion_ of the __Thames__.

	- _Confusion_ as the blurring of boundaries that creates abjection (__Kristeva__). Necessary scatology.

	- _Shit being eaten_ is the reason for which the poem eventually becomes profoundly disgusting.

- __A very important question__: why are we not doing anything with the __ending__?

- - -

##Structure

- Open by describing the way in which the __ending__ (the _closure_, the _margin_) of the collection actually works as an __opening__.

	- Necessary expansion of this idea.

- Sections:
	
	1. The city and its river
	
		1. The _subject matter_ of __The Famous Voyage__.

			- And, by the way - __FAME__ as the literary problem.

			- Absolutely about fame; absolutely about the book and its reception; absolutely about the literate scholar and its public.
	
	2. The poem and its _discharge_

		1. Form. Trying to get rid of the __epic__; the __epic__ flows back to you.
		
	3. The body and its soul
	
		1. The body of the city as the body itself;

		1. The material and the immaterial. The religious and the scientific.		
	
	4. The poet and his book


		1. Contrition.

- - -

- The epigrams as a laboratory of urban observations. How do we look at these types? How are they displayed / understood / presented? How do they __interact__? How do they possiblu develop? Where are they found? How do we find them?

	- There is an obvious focus on __appearances__ throughout the collection.

	- The descriptions of the __literary types__ construct a social identity and describe their __appearance__ within a __public sphere__ of _shared exposition_ - mutual exposure and observation. Just like that of the urban and the courtly types described elsewhere.

	- Abstract __literary__ ideas are treated as materially determined commodities.

	- The epigrams seem to place a lot of value in the __act of naming__.

		- People who are criticized are tipified (they bear allegorical, mocking names);
		
		- People who are celebrated are __named__.

- - -

##Poetaster

1. In scene 3 of act 5 __Crispinus__ is seen _vomiting words_.

> __Caesar__. Here be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man's ears.  
> __Horace__. Ay. Please it great Caesar, I have pills about me,  
> Mixed with the whitest kind of hellebore,  
> Would give him a light vomit that should purge  
> His brain and stomach of those tumultous heats  
> Might I have leave to minister unto him.  
> __Caesar__. O be his Aesculapius, gentle Horace;  
> You shall have leave, and he shall be your patient.  
> Virgil, use your authority, command him forth.  
> __Virgil__. Caesar is careful of your health, Crispinus,  
> And hath himself chose a physician  
> To minister unto you: take his pills.  
> __Horace__. [_Giving Crispinus a pill_] They are somewhat bitter,  
> sir, but very wholesome.  
> Take yet another, so. Stand by, they'll work anon.  
> __Tibullus__. Romans, return to your several seats. Lictors, bring forward the urn and set the accused at the bar.  
> [...]  
> __Crispinus__. [_Groaning_] O---  
> __Tibullus__. How now, Crispinus?  
> __Crispinus__. O, I am sick---  
> __Horace__. A basin, a basin, quickly; our physic works. [_To Crispinus_] Faint not, man.  
> [HORACE _holds a basin into which_ CRISPINUS _appears to vomit his words._]  
> __Crispinus__. O --- _retrograde_ --- _reciprocal_ --- _incubus_.  
> __Caesar__. What's that Horace?  
> __Horace__. [_Looking in the basin_] _Retrograde_, _reciprocal_ and _incubus_ are come up.  
> [...]  
> __Tibullus__. O Jupiter!  
> __Gallus__. Who would have thought there should ha' been such a deal of filth in a poet?  
> [...]  
> __Horace__. _Barmy froth_, _puffy_, _inflate_, _turgidous_ and _ventositous_ are come up.  
> __Tibullus__. O terrible windy words!  
> __Gallus__. A sign of a windy brain.  
> [...]  
> __Caesar__. Now all's come up, I trow. What a tumult he had in his belly!  
> [...]  
> __Horace.__ Force yourself then a little with your finger.  
> [CRISPINUS _pushes his finger down his throat._]  
> __Crispinus__. [_Loudly_] O -- O -- _prorumped_.  
> __Tibullus__. _Prorumped?_ What a noise it made! As if his spirit would have prorumped with it.  
> [...]  
> __Caesar__. _Clutched_? It's well that's come up! It had but a narrow passage.  
> [...]  
> __Virgil__. These pills can but restore him for a time,  
> Not cure him quite of such a malady  
> Caught by so many surfeits, which have filled  
> His blood and brain thus full of crudities.  
> 'Tis necessary therefore he observe  
> A strict and wholesome diet. [...]  

- Virgil then proceeds to describe a detailed diet that would __substitute__ the cultural products currently ingested by Crispinus. There is a definite analogy with what is happening in _FV_.

	- The date of composition is __spring or summer 1601__.

- The body is seen convulsing, trembling, melting into an ocean of vomit and farts. Crispinus' body is gushing forth the Fleet Street from both its mouth and its rectum (two-way).

- Another canonically disgusting scene in the wonderful BJ.

1. Similarly _classical_ context.

##The poem

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  

- [__Still not addressed__] On this note, it would be interesting to look at the function of _italics_ in this poem; was this typographical device a choice of the poet? Or an editorial intervention that we could impute to the printer? Also, how do these _italics_ work? Not only have we proper names of both mythical and historical - contemporary - figures; we have toponyms and place names. _Troyes_ and _hell_. Why is this equivalence set? Is this a feature that we could relate to our idea of London as an organism?

- We emphasized this notion a lot, the notion of falsity; and yet it still sounds unconvincing. Why? What can we do to improve it, to work on it?

	- Reject it because it is __false__; JH talks about _scare quotes_ as the ideological posture that ought to be used whenever I am addressing such culturally defined notions. That is - I should talk about how this move - __exclusion__ - is the move through which Jonson defines everything that is placed outside that boundary as false.

	- And the very notion of __boundary__ should deserve more attention. This is the creation of a cultural domain that is based on __exclusion__. Exclusion defines the inclusion, defines the boundary itself. We are everything that is not included here.

	- __Domain of a city__.

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  

- The prepositional adverb __save__ is possibly the element that should be further emphasized.

- __Confusion__: confusion of identity, confusion of culture, confusion of a mixed body. Threat of a mixed body; threat of a mixed body becoming its own shit.

- The contrast set between __here__ and __there__ is the contrast between the two sides of the boundary.

	- Something should be said - could be said, ought to be said - about the Fleet as a sort of boundary, therefore. The line that divides the body from the skin. __Skinning__ the boars

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> And, for the cryes of _Ghosts_, women, and men  
> Laden with plague-sores, and their sinnes, were heard,  
> Lash'd by their consciences, to die, affeard.  

- Fix the currency problem.

- Inspect the boundary between __material__ and __immaterial__. Materialism. Materialism is both consummerism and the new science, the science that has gotten rid of religion, the science that can do without religion.

> Then let the former age, with this content her,  
> Shee brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer.  

- Why is he using the _italics_ for the poets?

> __The Voyage It Selfe__

- The title as a boundary. Explanations of its effectiveness have been insufficient so far.

> I sing the brave adventure of two wights,  
> And pitty 'tis, I cannot call them knights:  

- Still relevant: _The shit that you write is similar to the shit that you hate; the things you keep closest - the things that you produce, that you put together, that you craft - are similar to the things that you have tried to get rid of. You are your own shit._ Here is the fear of Jonson as a writer - the fear of Jonson as a writer being _contaminated_ by the things that he, as a critic, refuses. I believe that we should think more about the very notion of __ecosystem__.

	- Ecosystem is: Jonson's writing; the poem itself; Jonson's mind; London; the Fleet; London's culture; English culture. All of these systems are being contaminated by their own shit. All of these ecosystems are eating their own shit. __Coprophagic fear__ as the heart of the poem.

	- Defining ecosytems at different levels; defining ecosystems as the primary idea at the core of the poem. Perhaps the structure of the whole thing should be revised: perhaps we should start with the __Fleet__ as the corrupt ecosystem described in the poem, then move onto the additional meanings (the poem itself; Jonson's writing; the city; the city's culture). 

> One was; and he, for brawne, and braine, right able  
> To have beene stiled of King _Arthurs_ table.  

> The other was a squire, of faire degree;  
> But, in the action, greater man than hee:  

> Who gave, to take at his returne from _Hell_,  
> His three for one. Now, lordings, listen well.  

- __Wager__.

>  
> It was the day, what time the powerfull _Moone_  
> Makes the poore _Banck-side_ creature wet it' shoone,  

> In it' owne hall; when these (in worthy scorne  
> Of those, that put on moneyes, on returne  
> From _Venice_, _Paris_, or some in-land passage  
> Of sixe times to, and fro, without embassage,  
> Or him that backward went to _Berwicke_, or which  
> Did dance the famous Morrisse, unto _Norwich_)  
> At _Bread-streets_ Mermaid, having din'd, and merry,  
> Propos'd to goe to _Hol'borne_ in a wherry:  
> A harder tasque, then either his to Bristo',  
> Or his to _Antwerpe_. Therefore, once more, list ho'.  

- __Hazard__. How is it relevant?

>  
> A _Docke_ there is, that called is _Avernus_,  
> Of some _Bride-well_, and may, in time, concerne us  
> All, that are readers: but, me thinkes 'tis od,  
> That all this while I have forgot some _god_,  
> Or _goddesse_ to invoke, to stuffe my verse;  

> And with both bombard-stile, and phrase, rehearse  
> The many perills of this _Port_, and how  
> Sans'helpe of _Sybil_, or a golden bough,  
> Or magick sacrifice, they past along!  
> _Alcides_, be thou succouring to my song.  

- __Material__ and __immaterial__? Age of __materialism__. Making the gods material.

> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  

> Great _Club-fist_, though thy backe, and bones be sore,  

- We are not doing enough with the idea of __mixture__.

> Still, with thy former labours; yet, once more,  
> Act a brave worke, call it thy last adventry:  
> But hold my torch, while I describe the entry  
> To this dire passage. Say, thou stop thy nose:  

- Still nothing done with Hercules and the Augean Stables. We should, again, be more explicit about our purpose and our ideas.

> 'Tis but light paines: Indeede this _Dock's_ no rose.  

- _Negation._ So what?

>  
> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts due cluster,  

- This is actually __not__ the description of a pure discharge; this is the description of something already being restituted to the reader. It is also the mixture between two physical states: solid and gas (atomic).

> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  

> Thorough her wombe they make their famous road,  
> Betweene two walls; where, on one side, to scar men,  
> Were seene your ugly _Centaures_, yee call Car-men,  
> _Gorgonian_ scolds, and _Harpyes_: on the other  
> Hung stench, diseases, and old filth, their mother,  
> With famine, wants, and sorrowes many a dosen,  
> The least of which was to the plague a cosen.  
> But they unfrighted passe, though many a privie  
> Spake to 'hem louder, then the oxe in _Livie_:  
> And many a sinke pour'd out her rage anenst 'hem;  
> But still their valour, and their vertue fenc't hem,  
> And, on they went, like _Castor_ brave, and _Pollux_:  
> Ploughing the mayne. When, see (the worst of all lucks)  
> They met the second Prodigie, would feare a  
> Man, that had never heard of a _Chimaera_.  

- Something should be done about this - the hypothetical man that never heard of a _Chimaera_.

> One said, it was bold _Briareus_, or the beadle,  
> (Who hath the hundred hands when he doth meedle)  
> The other thought it _Hydra_, or the trock  
> Made of the trull, that cut her fathers lock:  

- There is apparently a confusion - a mythological blindness here. Is it intentional?

> But, comming neere, they found it but a liter,  
> So huge, it seem'd, they could by no meanes quite her.  
> Backe cry'd their brace of _Charons_: they cry'd, no,  
> No going backe; on still you rogues, and row.  
> How hight the place? a voyce was heard, _Cocytus_.  
> Row close then slaves. Alas they will beshite us.  
> No matter, stinkards, row. What croaking sound  
> Is this we heare? of frogs? No, guts wind-bound,  
> Over your heads: Well, row. At this a loud  
> Crack did report it selfe, as if a cloud  
> Had burst with storme, and down fell, _ab excelsis_,  
> Poore _Mercury_, crying out on _Paracelsus_,  
> And all his followers, that had so abus'd him:  
> And, in so shitten sort, so long had us'd him:  

- _This is the same notion that we had encountered before: the re-using of culture; culture as an element of consumption._

> For (where he was the god of eloquence,  
> And subtlitie of mettalls) they dispense  
> His spirits, now, in pills, and eeke in potions,  
> Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions.  
> But many Moones there shall not wane (quoth hee)  

- Notice that there are no italics for either __Moone__ or __god__ here. Why?

> (In the meane time, let 'hem imprison mee)  
> But I will speake (and know I shall be heard)  
> Touching this cause, where they will be affeard  
> To answere me. And sure, it was th'intent  
> Of the grave fart, late let in parliament,  
> Had it beene seconded, and not in fume  
> Vanish'd away: as you must all presume  
> Their _Mercury_ did now. But this, the stemme  
> Of the hulke touch'd, and, as by _Polypheme_  
> The slie _Ulysses_ stole in a sheepes-skin,  
> The well-greas'd wherry now had got betweene,  
> And bad her _fare-well sough_, unto the lurden:  
> Never did bottom more betray her burden;  
> The meate-boate of Beares colledge, _Paris-garden_,  
> Stunke not so ill; nor, when shee kist, _Kate Arden_.  
> Yet, one day in the yeere, for sweet 'tis voyc't  
> And that is when it is the Lord _Maiors_ foist.  
>  
> By this time they had reach'd the _Stygian_ poole,  
> By which the _Masters_ sweare, when, on the stoole  
> Of worship, they their nodding chinnes doe hit  
> Against their breasts. Here, sev'rall ghosts did flit  
> About the shore, of farts, but late departed,  
> White, black, blew, greene, and in more formes outstarted,  
> Then all those _Atomi_ ridiculous,  
> Whereof old _Democrite_, and _Hill Nicholas_,  
> One said, the other swore, the world consists.  

- __Atoms__.

> These be the cause of those thicke frequent mists  
> Arising in that place, through which, who goes,  
> Must trie the un-used valour of a nose:  
> And that ours did. For yet, no nare was tainted,  

> Nor thumbe, nor finger to the stop acquainted,  
> But open, and un-armed encounter'd all:  
> Whether it languishing stucke upon the wall,  
> Or were precipitated downe the jakes,  
> And, after, swom abroad in ample flakes,  
> Or, that it lay, heap'd like an usurers masse,  
> All was to them the same, they were to passe,  
> And so they did, from _Styx_, to _Acheron_:  
> The ever-boyling floud. Whose bankes upon

> That, with still-scalding steemes, make the place _hell_.

> For, to say truth, what scullion is so nastie,  
> To put the skins, and offall in a pastie?  
> Cats there lay divers had beene flead, and rosted,  
> And, after mouldie growne, againe were tosted,  
> Then, selling not, a dish was tane to mince 'hem,  
> But still, it seem'd, the rankness did convince 'hem.  
> For, here they were throwne in with'the melted pewter,  
> Yet drown'd they not. They had five lives in future.  
> But 'mong'st these _Tiberts_, who do'you thinke there was?  
> Old _Bankes_ the juggler, our _Pythagoras_,  
> Grave tutor to the learned horse. Both wich,  
> Being, beyond sea, burned for one witch:  
> Their spirits transmigrated to a cat:  
> And now, above the poole, a face right fat  
> With great grey eyes, are lifted up, and mew'd;  
> Thrise did it spit: thrise div'd. At last, it view'd  
> Our brave _Heroes_ with a milder glare,  
> And, in a pittious tune, began. How dare  
> Your daintie nostrills (in so hot a season  
> When every clerke eats artichokes, and peason,  
> Laxative lettuce; and such windie meate)  
> Tempte such a passage? when each privies seate  
> Is fill'd with buttock? And the walls doe sweate  
> Urine, and plaisters? when the noise doth beate  
> Upon your eares, of discords so un-sweet?  

> And out-cryes of the damned in the _Fleet_?  
> Cannot the _Plague_-bill keepe you backe? nor bells  
> Of loud Sepulchres with their hourely knells,  
> But you will visit grisly _Pluto_'s hall?  
> Behold where _Cerberus_, rear'd on the wall  
> Of _Hol'borne_ (three sergeants heads) lookes ore,

> Tempt not his furie, _Pluto_ is away:

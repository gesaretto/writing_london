#The _Discharge_ of Epic

> In three parts: 1) the river; 2) the poem; 3) the city.

##Introduction

> [__This could still be the right way of opening.__] The function of the classic references that permeate Ben Jonson's _Epigramme CXXXIII_ has seldom been debated. Discussed for its "massive length," for its distance from the "encomiastic and condemnatory" tone of the collection that it concludes, and for its "disgusting" content matter, the poem, [also known as] [__<---__ why aka?] _The Famous Voyage_, has nevertheless consistently been categorized as a "mock-heroic narrative"  [@Boehrer2002, 9]. In this "interweav[_ing_] of satire and saturnalia," occasionally "enlivened by carnivalesque humour" [@McRae1998], the names and the circumstances of Greek epic would simply be evoked with "great irony" [@Medine1975, 98], and to participate in a "parody of high poetic forms" [@Robinson2014, 566]. [__Avoid the quotations.__] These labels, however, have managed to obscure the way in which the poem first repudiates and then welcomes again the elements of epic, in a cycle that mirrors closely the corrupt ecosystem of the setting that it describes - the River Fleet.

- __The final epigram is an opening.__: The final poem in Jonson's collection of _Epigrammes_, completed before 1612 and published for the first time in the 1616 folio of WORKES, is both a closure and an opening. It opens the collection both stylistically and thematically: it constitutes a change in register, presenting a longer and distinct form, and a change in topic, moving from the limited perspective of the portraits and the occasional texts of the collection, to an urban exploration - a voyage. The hundred and two preceding epigrams are different: they isolate a person or an event as if it were presented outside time and space - an individual and its flaws or merits; the joy or grief experienced in association to an event; a city type. Types are a recurring preoccupation in these pages: the city types and the literary types. City types, such as Admiral Cod or Chavalier Shift, seem to anticipate or accompany the model of city observation frequently found in the plays: types that mirror the conventions of the English genre of city comedy or city play, being associated with specific social categories or classes of the period, while they remind the reader of the analogue Roman or Greek model of the Old Comedy, or of the contemporary Commedia dell'Arte staged in Italy. The Epigrams are in fact a laboratory for these models, a repertoire of postures, costumes, faces and situations that can be used, or expanded, in dramatic depictions of the city.

- But these types, as we have said, occupy a non-narrative space in the book. They are found in the city, and then portrayed as specimens in a collection of pictures. The book is not narrative; it is suspended in a dimension of moralistic contemplation; it is exemplary and almost abstract. The _Voyage_, epigram CXXXIII is therefore different for the way in which it opens the narrative to a different genre and to a different style - it is a journey out of the boundaries defined by the collection, in a specific time and in a specific place. It is a journey, then, and a narrative one; and it is striking because it occupies a new space.

- __The final epigram is NOT a mock-heroic epic.__

- __Definition of ecosystem__.

Narrative, in fact, requires a specific time and a specific space. The time is now; the space is the Fleet.

##1. The River (context)

###Introductory moves

1. The Fleet Ditch is the true protagonist of _The Famous Voyage_. Although the first true toponym, _Bridwell Dock_, or the mouth of the Ditch, appears quite late in the poem, around line 42, a pronominal reference to the Fleet is made immediately after the mention of the two actors of the adventure, _Shelton_ and _Heyden_, in line 5: after having stated the superiority of his characters to that of the heroes of antiquity, the poet wishes to confirm the superiority of the setting: "one" river in london, the Fleet Ditch, is superior to all that is boasted of "_Styx_, of _Acheron_, _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_". The Fleet is the third character in the triade of protagonists who can surpass the canon of antiquity; but maybe even more than that. It is arguably the setting that allows for the magnitude of the adventure: the horrible condition of the Fleet, a hell on earth, is what allows for the very adventure to happen (to have this value).

2. But what are the reasons that justify this treatment of the ditch? Why was Jonson able to choose a specific site in London, and what was the experience that contributed to this choice? We know for a fact that the area surrounding the Fleet, after the mid nineteenth century only a subterranean canal in Fleet Street, was a notorious issue in Early Modern London: an urban and sanitary concern, at a time when the understanding of the propagation of disease and pollution was still developing; we do not know how aware Ben Jonson might have been about the problem of germs thriving in filth, __but we will soon__ [^fn-cockayne]. Contemporary discussions about the condition of the Ditch in the early 1600s in fact often quote from _The Famous Voyage_ as if it were a historical source comparable to any other; and indeed Ben Jonson seems especially conscious of the issues that a bystander - or a dweller - might have encountered every day on the banks of the waterway. Unsurprisingly, we have a confirmation of the fact that Jonson had experienced a very similar environment as he was growing up, when his family was living in Christopher Lane: an open sewer, similar to the one described by the poem and witnessed by Londoners every day on the Fleet, ran right at the center of the lane, contributing to unforgettable memories of unusual visual and olfactory sensations which Ben Jonson would have later used in the production of his last epigram [@Donaldson2011 103].

3. Like the sewer running in the middle of Christopher Lane, the Fleet Ditch was a site of waste disposal: it was the visible outpit for the garbage and discarded matter produced by an entire community; it was the core and the margin of a specific ecosystem - an ecosystem which was corrupt precisely because of its broken boundaries.

[^fn-cockayne]: @Cockayne2007 talks about the perception of "bad miasmas" (212).

> This rhetorical gesture is consonant with the setting of the adventure, the river Fleet through which the two comrades are cruising. Already "become worse cloyed and choken than ever it was before" at the time when John Stow was writing his _Survey_, "by means of continual encroachments upon the banks getting over the water, and casting of soilage into the stream", [@Stow, 73], the river notoriously received the largest share of the "rich stew" deriving "from domestic and trade sources, particles of earth, soot, sands, turds and rainwater," together with "the oily discharge from tanneries and the noxious and toxic waste products of the dyers' trade" [@Cockayne2007, 199-200]. The Fleet had the exclusive privilege of collecting the waste issued by a number of privies located just above it; but Jonson had probably experienced similar "sights and (more particularly) smells" during "childhood adventures outside of his house in Hartshorn Lane" [@Donaldson2011, 103]. The tangible scatology of this landscape is therefore consistent with the poetical idea that informs the epigram.

###The actual ecosystem

1. By definition, an ecosystem is characterized by two constitutive features: it is a delimited space, whose porous boundaries present nevertheless a definite interaction between inputs and outputs; and it host a distinguishable material cycle, often involving the interaction between animate and inanimate beings. Canonical examples of ecosystems, featuring both the distinctive presence of boundaries and a series of cyclical interactions between animal actors and the fixed elements of the environment, often include water: in its definition, @Gorham2011 lists "a wetland, a stream or lake, or - in the most logical case - a watershed within a sealed geological boundary." The two conditions, the boundaries and the cycles happening within the ecosystem, are of course related by the very idea of opposing inputs and outputs; a precise separation between what is being discarded and what is being received is crucial. The Fleet Ditch, as Ben Jonson presents it in his _Famous Voyage_, is no exception: it is bounded in space, extending only to the area covered by the stream itself and the adjacent - or superjacent - buildings; and it presents well defined cycles - trophic or symbiotic - which we will analyze more carefully in the following sections. But this ecosystem, as it is presented by Ben Jonson, is also categorically corrupt, and precisely in the two aspects that would by necessity define it - the boundaries and the cycle. On the one hand, in fact, the boundaries that define the input and the output of the matter being handled in the river are affected by a threatening mixture, which confounds what is being ejected with what is being ingested; on the other, the cylces defined by Ben Jonson are equally corrupt, since their end often strikingly coincides with its beginning.

2. The input and the output that define the presence of an ecosystem, and that are corrupt in the world depicted by Ben Jonson in the _Famous Voyage_, depend on the very idea of waste as matter that is for ever discarded. In her theorization of pollution, drawn from antrhopological, sociological, and theological observations, Mary Douglas connects in fact the production and the ideological definition of waste with the production and the ideological definition of a society's boundaries. A social group is united - it is ideologically gathered - around consonant ideas about what is worthy of being preserved and what, instead, can be discarded - or should be discarded; beyond these notions and beliefs, beyond the very collective perception of what can be considered cleanness and what, instead, has to be repelled as filth, lie the premises for the cultural and religious whole of a culturally cohesive group. Moments of selection and separation associated with the production of waste are therefore intrinsically related to the definition of a society; and they constitute powerful metaphors for expressing its most intimate functioning.

3. The Fleet Ditch is both a powerful site of production of waste - a concrete boundary delimiting what is kept and what has to be discarded from the city - and a crucial metaphor for a number of different activities. On its banks, in fact, we would find a number of workshops and houses whose production of waste was crucial in providing the river with its distinctive texture and sensorial qualities. Tanners, soap-makers, butchers, and cooks: each one of these professions, inevitably referred to by Ben Jonson, was characterized by the use of animal products or animal carcasses, which had to be processed and refined. Basically, each one of these activities resulted in the definition of a product to be sold, bought, and consumed, and of some raw material to be discarded. The production of waste was therefore immediately associated with the requirements of the market economy thriving on the banks of the course; it was an intrinsic part of this society, and a vital metaphor for its working at large.

4. The raw matter discarded by the production of these products would find a natural site of disposal in the river itself - or in the Ditch itself. As Jonson describes, people would simply through out the unused matter in the stream, expecting the water to carry it away. The waterway was considered as the principal output way of the entire ecosystem; it was the destination of any matter that did not deserve to actively participate in the economy of the neighborhood, and that instead had to be thrown away with the rest. Waste derived from workshops and shops wasn't the only matter that, on the river, was thrown away in this way; it wasn't, besides, the most prominent one. As we know, the Fleet had the special privilege among the rest of the city's waterways of hosting a number of privies on its banks: the human waste produced there ended in the waterway itself.

- - -

1. The fact that the Fleet Ditch had become the destination of both commercial garbage and human waste (faecal matter) is at the core of one major intuition within the text, one that Ben Jonson uses profusely to describe the ways and the reasons for which the specific ecosystem of the Fleet could be considered corrupt and broken. This intuition is consonant with one of the major assumptions found in _Purity and danger_, and with a privileged metaphor for the functioning of urban spaces and specific neighborhoods that is often found in the literary works of the time: the idea of the city as a body, and the idea of the expulsion of discarded matter as the process which sanctions the existence of boundaries; the process which enables the existence of boundaries. As McRae points out in his insightful analysis of border making in the poem, the Fleet becomes a metonymy for the digestive trait of the entire city, defined by its processes of ingestion and expulsion.

2. Grounded on the ideas of waste as the rational way of defining the boundaries of a society, or of an enclosed ecosystem , two images seem in fact to sustain the poetical substance of _The Famous Voyage_: the city as a human body and the city as a book (or, more broadly, as a textual product). As we will see in the rest of this paper, Ben Jonson describes the corruption of both systems to convey the critical state of corruption in which was found the Fleet, to later expand his critique to the cultural and literary landscape of his age in general. 

	- Possible references to relevant literature describing the city as a body.

- - -

1. We use evidence _from the text_ to describe how the ecosystem of the Fleet is inherently corrupt and unsustainable; we use the metaphor of the city as a body, and we do not refer to the problem of epic yet.

The first half of the text is consequently devoted to the thematization of this literary and urban purge. As McRae has convincingly demonstrated, the leading motive in the description of the ditch is its assimilation to "the alimentary canal, understood in Renaissance medical theory to be a single channel winding through the body, which received and digested food, and subsequently ejected food." One of the most suggestive inventions of the poem, then, is that for which we follow the travelers along an unorthodox trajectory, moving "haltingly through images of excretion to images of the preparation and consumption of food" [@McRae1998]. Because of this inversion, the first threat encountered by the adventurers exemplarily embodies the collective waste matter of London. 

> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts due cluster,  
> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  
> (61-65)  

The poet insists on the notions of emission ("Belch'd forth") and ejection ("discharge"), while at the same time assimilating the bodily functions of the monstruous _Mud_ to the activity of the marketplace, where "carts" constantly exchange their "load." This excretion is therefore an integral part of the "natural, inescapable phenomenon" of "commercial transaction" [@Bruster1992, 16] in the organism of the city. This hyperbolical "discharge" of excrement is, in fact, intentionally provoked by its producers, who consume those "spirits, [...] pills, and [...] potions, | Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions" (101-102) which, "in shitten sort" (98), will purge their bodies from the unhealthy food that they consume every day.

As we ascend the alimentary canal individuated by McRae, in fact, we discover culinary practices that are everything but salubrious. The section of the poem concerning the "hot cookes" of "_Fleet_-lane" (145) is pervaded by the impressions of an incessant contamination, and reciprocal poisoning, between the waste discarded in the river - "grease, and haire of meazled hogs, | The heads, houghs, entrailes and the hides of dogs" (145-146) - and the food prepared there. Jonson must have personally witnessed this perverted ecosystem, where "pigs picked up contamination from city industries and noisome ditches filled with night soil and street sweepings," while "rottling in the back alleys and dunghills, [...] Mingling with dogs" or propagating "the circulation of disease and intestinal worms"  [@Cockayne2007, 95-97]. The stray and domestic animals that were "flead, and roasted | And, after mouldie growne, againe [...] tosted" (149-150) ingested the waste discarded in the river, before being themselves ingested by the humans responsible for its contamination. What is expelled is equivalent to what is absorbed: this horrendous revelation awaits the adventurers at the end of their _Voyage_, which becomes shockingly similar to its start.

As a result, although the thematic shift from excrement to nourishment observed by McRae is undoubtable, the alimentary matter of the poem is indistinguishable from its fecal counterpart. A threatening uncertainty suffuses the "monstruous femininity" of this urban setting, evocative of a "grotesque female body with the Ditch a filthy channel into it, [...] ambiguously mouth, vagina, and anus" [@Robinson2014, 569]. The origin of this ambiguity might be related to what Julia Kristeva defined as "_abject_ [...], the jettisoned object" which, being "radically excluded [_,_] draws [_one_] towards the place where meaning collapses" [@Kristeva2002, 230]. This collapse in meaning, provoked by a sudden encounter with the "body fluids, [...] defilement, [...] shit" and "death" [@Kristeva2002, 231] of the Fleet, is equivalent to the "confus[_ion_] described by the poet of the _Famous Voyage_ in its _proemium_.

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  
> (7-10)

The four rivers of Hades converge into a single earthly waterway, constituting a numerical equivalence that would still motivate a consumer's preference for the contemporary adventure over the old epic. But this sum reveals a fault, introduced by the concessive phrase "save only": the rational, "subtl[_e_] distin[_ction_]" between the discrete elements of that written world of "Poets" is, in the reality witnessed by Jonson and his "adventurer[s]," turned into an unutterable jumble of "filth, stench, noyse." This quality returns in the compound "merd-urinous" (65), used to describe the inextricably mixed constituents of the waste polluting the river, and in the invocation to "_Alcides_" (50) that is disingenuously introduced by the poet after the beginning of his _Voyage_.

- - -

1. _The Famous Voyage_ is a revolting poem for many reasons; yet, we think that the corruption of its ecosystem, described in the mixture between output and input, between discarded and preserved, between ingested and expelled, is perhaps the most disgusting idea at the core of the poem. This is the moment when the threatening inversion described by Douglas, a cultural taboo in many of the culture which she analyzes, becomes equivalent to an even more destabilizing threat - one that pushes the self back into the pre-symbolic order in which boundaries are not only threatened, but cease to exist - the abjection described by Kristeva in _The Powers of Horror_. This transition is the most disturbing feature of _Famous Voyage_, and, as we will see the disappearance of boundaries is at the core of the final transition operated by the poet, from the material to the immaterial - and back.

	- The dissolution of boundaries is the dissolution of the self and its linguistic categories; these linguistic categories are again upturned in the final section of the poem.

	- The end of this section should transition from the violation of boundaries expressed in Douglas to the pure abjection theorized by Kristeva. This discovery is perhaps the most revolting idea contained in the poem; it is the perverse absorption of waste through air and - more strikingly - food.

##2. The poem (the purge)

1. The second privileged metaphor used to describe London in the literary works of the time, and the second metaphor that Ben Jonson uses to describe the Fleet and the culture and society which produced its corruption, is that of the city as a book. There are two ways in which this idea seems to be suggested in the text: one is extratextual, linked to the editorial practices usually attributed to Ben Jonson, and the second is textual, linked to the specific literary operation that Ben Jonson performs in his work.

	- The city as a book; the book as a corrupt ecosystem.

	- The form of the poem mirrors its theme.

- - -

###The Epigrammes and editorial practices

1. The Epigrams occupy the - - -

	- The epigrammes within the folio, and the Voyage within the epigrams. What is the meaning of these choices? How do they define margins? How do they mirror practices of discarding and delimiting boundaries?

	- The job of Ben Jonson as that of a tanner / butcher / soap maker.

- - -

###The purge: false occupatio and denial

1. In the final section of his early comedy _Poetaster_, written around the Summer of 1601 - approximately ten years before the completion of the _Epigrams_ - the character referred to in the title, _Crispinus_, undergoes a peculiar literary treatment, performed by the ingenious medicinal powers of the quintessential satyrist, Horace. In the presence of Caesar, Virgil and Tibullus, the bad poet is given some special pills, "somewhat bitter [...], but very wholesome." As soon as these medicaments have effect on the patient, Crispinus starts groaning.
  
> __Crispinus__. [_Groaning_] O---  
> __Tibullus__. How now, Crispinus?  
> __Crispinus__. O, I am sick---  
> __Horace__. A basin, a basin, quickly; our physic works. [_To Crispinus_] Faint not, man.  
> [HORACE _holds a basin into which_ CRISPINUS _appears to vomit his words._]  
> __Crispinus__. O --- _retrograde_ --- _reciprocal_ --- _incubus_.  
> __Caesar__. What's that Horace?  
> __Horace__. [_Looking in the basin_] _Retrograde_, _reciprocal_ and _incubus_ are come up.  

	- Analysis of the opening of _Poetaster_.

	- Make it good - do some _actual_ close reading here (and of the following passages).

[__Poetaster: we need to look at it.__] We could indeed compare the treatment of epic referents in the epigram's _proemium_, entitled _On the Famous Voyage_, to the "literal purge of bad language" which in _Poetaster_ embodied "a materialized enactment of humanistic education" and "literary criticism" [@Robinson2014, 563]. [<--- Stop doing this.] In a similar fashion, the poet begins his epigram by listing all that his narrative will _not_ include.

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  
> (1-6)  

Although reminiscent of an _occupatio_ - a denial to indulge in the narration of events that the same denial is in fact contradictorily relating - these first six lines do not reveal anything about the characters and places which they mention. Encompassed by a double negation, "NO" and "not", these referents are simply _named_, for the sole purpose of being discarded. This first rhetorical gesture is an act of exclusion and the setting of a boundary: before the actual incipit of the poem, "_The Voyage It Selfe_", the poet needs to push a number of elements outside of it.

A typographical mark, the same _italic_ font elsewhere personally curated by Ben Jonson [@Riddell2000, 156], signals the entity of the referents marked for expulsion. They are the proper names of classical heroes (_Hercules_, _Theseus_, _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_), to which is added a single, unspecified _Latine Muse_, and three places: a nameless _hell_, rhyming with the deceiving "tell" performed by antiquity, and two toponyms - _Greece_ and _Troyes_. The name of the country and the name of the city - suggestive of the _New Troy_ that is London - open and close the sequence, narrowing down the reader's attention from a cultural to an urban synecdoche, signifying, like every name on the list, the entirety of those "bolder fables" with which classical literature "our faiths abuse."

The initial rejection is indeed followed by a fitting replacement for the discarded matter. In the following lines the poet asserts the superiority of his composition, both in quality and in quantity.

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> (11-14)

The character behind this designation, Hercules, is a hybrid born of a human, Alcmene, and a god, Zeus. His origin is mixed, like the waters of the Fleet: this duality, underscored by the reference to Alcaeus, the human grandfather remembered in the patronymic, is then emphasized by the ambivalent way in which the poet refers to the frail humanity of his "backe, and bones [_,_] sore" from his "former labors" (55), while attributing to him an undisputable divinity.

> Thou hast seene _hell_ (some say) and know'st all nookes there,  
> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  
> (51-54)

In the "confusion" of this passage, like in the corrupt ecosystem of the Fleet, what has been expelled is absorbed again. The poet's apparent forgetfulness ("me thinkes 'tis od, | that all this while I forgot some _god_", 43-44) is allowing him to reincorporate the epic material that he had just discarded, feeding to the reader the exact same content that, within the liminal space of the _proemium_, had been so scrupulously listed, denied and purged. Even the rhyme returns: accepting what "some say" and what "_Fame_" has transmitted to him, the poet is allowing the "_Muses_" to "abus[_e_]" both his and his reader's "faith" (4). And indeed, as he navigates the turbid waters of the river, having entered its "wombe" (66), all of this discarded epic material flows back to the poet, encroaching and soiling the setting, the adventure, and its characters. In a mode that is "increasingly phantasmagoric and allegorical" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 261], and which parades an increasing accumulation of "_Centaures_," "_Gorgons_," and a "_Harpyes_" (68-69), epic repossesses the epigram, like "The slie _Ulysses_ [...] in a sheepes-skin" (113), thus debasing the system of exclusions and positive replacements that had compelled both the author and the reader to wager on its success.

##3. The age (the city)

1. I would now like to focus on the second part of the poem, and on the way in which Ben Jonson specifically introduces two distinct figures that participate in defining not only an ecological indictment about the negative consequences of commercial thriving, but also a cultural indictment about the consequences of the commodification of culture, of which Jonson was becoming responsible right at the moment when he decided to collect his _Epigrammes_ with the purpose of publication. The two references that I would like to consider, therefore, are the one to __Mercurius__ in the section of the poem devoted to the collective purge of the inhabitants of the area, and that to Democrite and to Pythagoras in the final section of the poem. 

2. At the core of both these moments we find an analogous slippage: the one that seems, in the end, to justify the way in which abstract matter - the erudite references to the epic matter of Virgil and Homer - are turned into concrete waste that responds to the physical rules of expulsion and pollution. The idea is simple: metonymy creates a sort of vibrant weight, of oscillating weight, for which some of these referents can possess a definite value, bounded in time and space, and some others do not. _Mercury_ is perhaps the most evident example: when he is first mentioned, in the poem, we think that he is a divinity, another inconsistent invocation to a dead god disappeared with the supposed advancement of history and culture. But this is not the case - Ben Jonson is not exclusively referring to the deity, a name as inconsistent as the rest of the fictional characters that inhabit this poetical space; he is in fact referring to the homonymous metal, the _mercury_ whom _Paracelsus_ transformed into the appropriate element that ought to be used for the treatment of constipation. Mercurius is both; time has turned the name into a different item, into a commodity that can be ingested and expelled, and at the same time into its own memory. At the basis of Jonson's complaint about Mercury's debasement, then, is a problematic treatment of metonymy and personification: Mercury is both the god and the metal that can be used to treat constipation.

###Religion and science

3. Metonymy and personification here stand for two different viewpoints; for two different Zeitgeisten - the religious viewpoint that associated Mercury with the divine messenger and protector of pharmacy, and that which instead sees in the name only an element useful to produce pills which, again, force to body to expell its impurities. 

4. Similarly, in the final part of the poem, religious and scientific ideas mix again in order to create a confusing effect.

	- Be sure to include these ideas:

		- "Mercury" - the name (deity) and the thing (metal);

		- atomic shit.

###A commercial exchange

- Signposting (recap) and question: we have a certain awareness of what Ben Jonson has done so far: he has described three corrupt ecosystems - the river, the poem, and the culture of the city - and he has connected their corruption to the developing market practices foudnd within them. In a concentrical move, the three disgraces are connected: the ditch, the poem, and the cultural context of the city. But what are the financial practices that ground this decay? What are the criteria that lead the market to these mistakes?

- Perhaps we should explain how the poem is the privileged space for the exposition of these criteria: Ben Jonson is in fact completing a financial transaction in front of the reader - for the reader, as the reference to the practice of "wager journeys" implies.

- - -

After the purge and exchange of the _proemium_, the opening lines of the _The Voyage It Selfe_ indeed reiterate the correlation between the transactions that inform the poem and those that grant its marketability. Through a number of specific references to "authenticated exploits of the day" [most of them successfully identified by @Donaldson2011, pp. 32-34], the voyage is compared to those "wager journeys" that "had long since established [_themselves_] as a recognizable component of England's pervasive performance culture" [@Manous2009, 3] : expeditions to "_Venice_, _Paris_, [...] _Berwicke_" or "_Norwich_" (33-36). In these circumstances, wagerers would actually "put on moneyes" _against_ the chances of the traveler. As Manous explains, "If the journey was not completed and verified according to the terms of the wager, the traveler forfeited this sum; but if the journey was successfully completed and verified [...], the traveler was typically owed [...] a threefold to fivefold increase" [@Manous2009, 8-9]. Similarly, the poet seems to be prompting his readers, here asked twice to "listen well" (28, 40), to invest the "three for one" (28) of their attention on this literary journey, which will be completed according to the terms declared at the beginning - namely the exclusion of the false beliefs of classical literature in favor of an original and authenticated adventure.

- "Let us have a closer look at how the exchange is described within the poem":

	- If the symmetrical absence of a "saile," elliptical about the "tenuous analogy" between the two vessels, might be an ironical marker for the clumsiness of the whole comparison [@Duncan-Jones2005, 258], the subsequent substitutions present an undoubtable increase in intensity and number. The poem will feature "two [...] knaves" instead of one _Charon_, and both "more horride" than him. The idyllic _frogs_, which in Aristophanes' play accompanied Dyonisus' journey to Hades, will be replaced by the noisy emissions of "Arses," with a shift that adds smell to sound. Pure quantity motivates the exchange between "one _Cerberus_" and a hyperbolic "coast" of "dogs." Furthermore, the refusal of the _Furies_ in favor of the "scolds," linkable to the ideologically pervasive "process of commodity evaluation" [@Bruster1992, 16], overtly obeys to the principles of the marketplace. The _scolds_ are not superior to the _Furies_ in any specific attribute, nor are they more. Instead, working at the intersection between quantity and quality, we find a numerical correspondence between their worth - "each scold was ten."  Appraised on a decimal scale, _Furies_ and scolds function as the different coins of a single currency: we discard one and prefer the other because of their monetary value.

- Answer:

	- The criteria are the __new__ and the __authentic__;

	- To explain the __new__ and the __authentic we will refer to:

		1. the play "Every Man out of his Humor" (for the new);

- Might be useful to remember that: _Falsity and superstition introduce the problem of religion; but not here._

> The poet has established an exchange based on the acquisition of what is allegedly both new and true, consistently with the principles "of a [growing] consumer society" [@Thirsk1978, 106], and enabled by the discarding of an old, fallacious tradition, signified by the disposal of the synecdochical referents in the _proemium_. As we have seen, Jonson had already compared similar processes of literary selection to a "purge": the fragments of epic and superstition that have been repudiated have thus become excrements, left behind by the sailless wherry of this poetical _Famous Journey_.

> Falsity and superstition seem to be the main reasons for the disposal of this cultural patrimony. Analogous to the inhabitants of another notoriously fabulous genre, chivalric romance, the "just knights" of these "tales" are condemned because of their lack of "power," to which the poet means to oppose a true "act." As it has been observed, this allegedly true narrative produces "an impression of realism and inclusiveness" through its "pervasive topicality" [@Medine1975, 98]. The stark contrast between the third person of the first four lines ("they") and the first person of the fifth ("We"), together with the naming of two protagonists, "_Shelton_" and "_Heyden_", probably known only to "those readers who had drunk regularly with them at the Mermaid tavern" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 259], aim at proving the authenticity of the story. Antiquity "brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer" (20): the poem is purged from the fallacious beliefs of the past, and pervaded by witnessed everyday experience.

The literary dispute between old fables and new adventures is thus transformed into a commercial exchange, based on quantity and measurable worth. This monetization must have resonated with Ben Jonson's constant concerns about the "unprecedented importance [_of_] coins," and about the problematic "correspondence between an object and its [monetary] value" [@Burlison2010, 285] - especially at the time of completing his collection of epigrams. Before its definitive publication in the _Works_ of 1616, the series was "licensed for issue in 1612 as a self-contained volume" [@Miles1990, 170], a project which was never concretized. Nevertheless, the expectation of a published product must have been troubling for Jonson, who was probably still wavering between his affection for "the notion of coterie poetry and manuscript circulation" and the inevitable "lure of print" [@Donaldson2000, 123]. His poems, which he considered "more important than anything he had written for performance" [@Miles1990, 169], would leave the privileged space of literary circles to become another of the many "consumer goods that could never be deemed essential for life" [@Thirsk1978, 78]. The negotiations that give shape to the microorganism of _The Famous Voyage_ mirror the major financial concerns surrounding the public circulation of his works and his identity.

- Do not forget:

	- _here we need Bruster_: we need to work on him, to expand our understanding of him and so on;

	- the __famous__ voyage - why this adjective? It would be useful to emphasize how, in the end, the poem is a reflection on a literary practice.

##Conclusion

###Contrition and confession

- Conclusion: Ben Jonson is responsible for the decay of his cultural ecosystem, because he published - or because he wanted to publish - his epigrams, transforming his ideas into a book that has to be sold.

	- Could this conclusion still be stupid?

		- It will be if you don't properly link it to every single premise; the fact that he is associating this move - his decision to publish the poems - with the commodification of culture; the fact that the commodification of culture is responsible for the broken exchange that is at the basis of the _Famous Voyage_; the fact that this commodification of culture produces the violation of boundaries that corrupts the entire social and intellectual ecosystem.

#The _Discharge_ of Epic

- __The final epigram is an opening.__

The final poem in Jonson's collection of _Epigrammes_, completed before 1612 and published for the first time in the 1616 folio of WORKES, is both a closure and an opening. It opens the collection both stylistically and thematically: it constitutes a change in register, presenting a longer and distinct form, and a change in topic, moving from the limited perspective of the portraits and the occasional texts of the collection, to an urban exploration - a voyage. The hundred and two preceding epigrams are different: they isolate a person or an event as if it were presented outside time and space - an individual and its flaws or merits; the joy or grief experienced in association to an event; a city type. Types are a recurring preoccupation in these pages: the city types and the literary types. City types, such as Admiral Cod or Chavalier Shift, seem to anticipate or accompany the model of city observation frequently found in the plays: types that mirror the conventions of the English genre of city comedy or city play, being associated with specific social categories or classes of the period, while they remind the reader of the analogue Roman or Greek model of the Old Comedy, or of the contemporary Commedia dell'Arte staged in Italy. The Epigrams are in fact a laboratory for these models, a repertoire of postures, costumes, faces and situations that can be used, or expanded, in dramatic depictions of the city.

But these types, as we have said, occupy a non-narrative space in the book. They are found in the city, and then portrayed as specimens in a collection of pictures. The book is not narrative; it is suspended in a dimension of moralistic contemplation; it is exemplary and almost abstract. The _Voyage_, epigram CXXXIII is therefore different for the way in which it opens the narrative to a different genre and to a different style - it is a journey out of the boundaries defined by the collection, in a specific time and in a specific place. It is a journey, then, and a narrative one; and it is striking because it occupies a new space.

> [__This could still be the right way of opening.__] The function of the classic references that permeate Ben Jonson's _Epigramme CXXXIII_ has seldom been debated. Discussed for its "massive length," for its distance from the "encomiastic and condemnatory" tone of the collection that it concludes, and for its "disgusting" content matter, the poem, [also known as] [__<---__ why aka?] _The Famous Voyage_, has nevertheless consistently been categorized as a "mock-heroic narrative"  [@Boehrer2002, 9]. In this "interweav[_ing_] of satire and saturnalia," occasionally "enlivened by carnivalesque humour" [@McRae1998], the names and the circumstances of Greek epic would simply be evoked with "great irony" [@Medine1975, 98], and to participate in a "parody of high poetic forms" [@Robinson2014, 566]. [__Avoid the quotations.__] These labels, however, have managed to obscure the way in which the poem first repudiates and then welcomes again the elements of epic, in a cycle that mirrors closely the corrupt ecosystem of the setting that it describes - the River Fleet.


- __Definition of ecosystem__.

Narrative, in fact, requires a specific time and a specific space. The time is now; the space is the Fleet.

The River Fleet is the occasion that originates the journey; it is the space that permeates every angle and every word of the poem. It is the smell of the poem, it is its consistency. 

- List of the shit found in the Fleet;

- focus on the professions of the soap makers and the tanners; 

- focus on the production of a boundary.

- __The final epigram is NOT a mock-heroic epic.__

##The actual ecosystem

- __Here we need to talk about the Fleet.__

	- __Ben Jonson on the Fleet.__ What is known about the poem: there was a lot of shit here.

- The setting. What is the Fleet. Why it is a problem.

	- Two ideas at the basis of the notion of _ecosystem_: __cycle__ and __boundary__. They are both corrupt in the Fleet. The __cycle__ is fucked up, because the __boundary__ is not working as it should (and vice versa); the __input__ becomes the __output__.

> The poet has established an exchange based on the acquisition of what is allegedly both new and true, consistently with the principles "of a [growing] consumer society" [@Thirsk1978, 106], and enabled by the discarding of an old, fallacious tradition, signified by the disposal of the synecdochical referents in the _proemium_. As we have seen, Jonson had already compared similar processes of literary selection to a "purge": the fragments of epic and superstition that have been repudiated have thus become excrements, left behind by the sailless wherry of this poetical _Famous Journey_.

- __Production of waste as the very basic definition of an ecosystem; production of waste as the definition of a boundary.__

	- Here we use Douglas.

The Fleet is the true protagonist of _Famous Voyage_.

The river is also the quintessential ecosystem; and the Fleet is no exception.

> This rhetorical gesture is consonant with the setting of the adventure, the river Fleet through which the two comrades are cruising. Already "become worse cloyed and choken than ever it was before" at the time when John Stow was writing his _Survey_, "by means of continual encroachments upon the banks getting over the water, and casting of soilage into the stream", [@Stow, 73], the river notoriously received the largest share of the "rich stew" deriving "from domestic and trade sources, particles of earth, soot, sands, turds and rainwater," together with "the oily discharge from tanneries and the noxious and toxic waste products of the dyers' trade" [@Cockayne2007, 199-200]. The Fleet had the exclusive privilege of collecting the waste issued by a number of privies located just above it; but Jonson had probably experienced similar "sights and (more particularly) smells" during "childhood adventures outside of his house in Hartshorn Lane" [@Donaldson2011, 103]. The tangible scatology of this landscape is therefore consistent with the poetical idea that informs the epigram.

- - -

Mary Douglas theorization of pollution might be useful here. In her book _Purity and Danger_, the author connects the idea of waste to the production of those margins that are essential to society: boundaries are defined by the expulsion of discarded matter. 

This image is a mirror of the human body; but the human body is also a privileged metaphor for any sort of bounded society.

###The bodies: the book, the city, the human

The ecosystem of the Fleet is an integral part of the urban ecosystem of London. And London is often compared to two similes in the literature of the time: the body and the book. Similarly, the _Famous Voyage_ is both a reflection on the city as a body and on the city as a readable book.

- - -

###Eating shit is here: a corrupt ecosystem

The first half of the text is consequently devoted to the thematization of this literary and urban purge. As McRae has convincingly demonstrated, the leading motive in the description of the ditch is its assimilation to "the alimentary canal, understood in Renaissance medical theory to be a single channel winding through the body, which received and digested food, and subsequently ejected food." One of the most suggestive inventions of the poem, then, is that for which we follow the travelers along an unorthodox trajectory, moving "haltingly through images of excretion to images of the preparation and consumption of food" [@McRae1998]. Because of this inversion, the first threat encountered by the adventurers exemplarily embodies the collective waste matter of London. 

> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts due cluster,  
> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  
> (61-65)  

The poet insists on the notions of emission ("Belch'd forth") and ejection ("discharge"), while at the same time assimilating the bodily functions of the monstruous _Mud_ to the activity of the marketplace, where "carts" constantly exchange their "load." This excretion is therefore an integral part of the "natural, inescapable phenomenon" of "commercial transaction" [@Bruster1992, 16] in the organism of the city. This hyperbolical "discharge" of excrement is, in fact, intentionally provoked by its producers, who consume those "spirits, [...] pills, and [...] potions, | Suppositories, cataplasmes, and lotions" (101-102) which, "in shitten sort" (98), will purge their bodies from the unhealthy food that they consume every day.

As we ascend the alimentary canal individuated by McRae, in fact, we discover culinary practices that are everything but salubrious. The section of the poem concerning the "hot cookes" of "_Fleet_-lane" (145) is pervaded by the impressions of an incessant contamination, and reciprocal poisoning, between the waste discarded in the river - "grease, and haire of meazled hogs, | The heads, houghs, entrailes and the hides of dogs" (145-146) - and the food prepared there. Jonson must have personally witnessed this perverted ecosystem, where "pigs picked up contamination from city industries and noisome ditches filled with night soil and street sweepings," while "rottling in the back alleys and dunghills, [...] Mingling with dogs" or propagating "the circulation of disease and intestinal worms"  [@Cockayne2007, 95-97]. The stray and domestic animals that were "flead, and roasted | And, after mouldie growne, againe [...] tosted" (149-150) ingested the waste discarded in the river, before being themselves ingested by the humans responsible for its contamination. What is expelled is equivalent to what is absorbed: this horrendous revelation awaits the adventurers at the end of their _Voyage_, which becomes shockingly similar to its start.

###Confusion and pollution: the fusion of boundaries

As a result, although the thematic shift from excrement to nourishment observed by McRae is undoubtable, the alimentary matter of the poem is indistinguishable from its fecal counterpart. A threatening uncertainty suffuses the "monstruous femininity" of this urban setting, evocative of a "grotesque female body with the Ditch a filthy channel into it, [...] ambiguously mouth, vagina, and anus" [@Robinson2014, 569]. The origin of this ambiguity might be related to what Julia Kristeva defined as "_abject_ [...], the jettisoned object" which, being "radically excluded [_,_] draws [_one_] towards the place where meaning collapses" [@Kristeva2002, 230]. This collapse in meaning, provoked by a sudden encounter with the "body fluids, [...] defilement, [...] shit" and "death" [@Kristeva2002, 231] of the Fleet, is equivalent to the "confus[_ion_] described by the poet of the _Famous Voyage_ in its _proemium_.

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  
> (7-10)

The four rivers of Hades converge into a single earthly waterway, constituting a numerical equivalence that would still motivate a consumer's preference for the contemporary adventure over the old epic. But this sum reveals a fault, introduced by the concessive phrase "save only": the rational, "subtl[_e_] distin[_ction_]" between the discrete elements of that written world of "Poets" is, in the reality witnessed by Jonson and his "adventurer[s]," turned into an unutterable jumble of "filth, stench, noyse." This quality returns in the compound "merd-urinous" (65), used to describe the inextricably mixed constituents of the waste polluting the river, and in the invocation to "_Alcides_" (50) that is disingenuously introduced by the poet after the beginning of his _Voyage_.

##The purge

- __The form of the poem mirrors its theme.__

###The purge: false occupatio and denial (1)

[__Poetaster: we need to look at it.__] We could indeed compare the treatment of epic referents in the epigram's _proemium_, entitled _On the Famous Voyage_, to the "literal purge of bad language" which in _Poetaster_ embodied "a materialized enactment of humanistic education" and "literary criticism" [@Robinson2014, 563]. [<--- Stop doing this.] In a similar fashion, the poet begins his epigram by listing all that his narrative will _not_ include.

> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  
> (1-6)  

Although reminiscent of an _occupatio_ - a denial to indulge in the narration of events that the same denial is in fact contradictorily relating - these first six lines do not reveal anything about the characters and places which they mention. Encompassed by a double negation, "NO" and "not", these referents are simply _named_, for the sole purpose of being discarded. This first rhetorical gesture is an act of exclusion and the setting of a boundary: before the actual incipit of the poem, "_The Voyage It Selfe_", the poet needs to push a number of elements outside of it.

A typographical mark, the same _italic_ font elsewhere personally curated by Ben Jonson [@Riddell2000, 156], signals the entity of the referents marked for expulsion. They are the proper names of classical heroes (_Hercules_, _Theseus_, _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_), to which is added a single, unspecified _Latine Muse_, and three places: a nameless _hell_, rhyming with the deceiving "tell" performed by antiquity, and two toponyms - _Greece_ and _Troyes_. The name of the country and the name of the city - suggestive of the _New Troy_ that is London - open and close the sequence, narrowing down the reader's attention from a cultural to an urban synecdoche, signifying, like every name on the list, the entirety of those "bolder fables" with which classical literature "our faiths abuse."

- - -

###The Purge: Replacement (2)

The initial rejection is indeed followed by a fitting replacement for the discarded matter. In the following lines the poet asserts the superiority of his composition, both in quality and in quantity.

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> (11-14)

##The purge: consequences in literature

###From shitting to eating


The character behind this designation, Hercules, is a hybrid born of a human, Alcmene, and a god, Zeus. His origin is mixed, like the waters of the Fleet: this duality, underscored by the reference to Alcaeus, the human grandfather remembered in the patronymic, is then emphasized by the ambivalent way in which the poet refers to the frail humanity of his "backe, and bones [_,_] sore" from his "former labors" (55), while attributing to him an undisputable divinity.

> Thou hast seene _hell_ (some say) and know'st all nookes there,  
> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  
> (51-54)

###The return of the discarded

In the "confusion" of this passage, like in the corrupt ecosystem of the Fleet, what has been expelled is absorbed again. The poet's apparent forgetfulness ("me thinkes 'tis od, | that all this while I forgot some _god_", 43-44) is allowing him to reincorporate the epic material that he had just discarded, feeding to the reader the exact same content that, within the liminal space of the _proemium_, had been so scrupulously listed, denied and purged. Even the rhyme returns: accepting what "some say" and what "_Fame_" has transmitted to him, the poet is allowing the "_Muses_" to "abus[_e_]" both his and his reader's "faith" (4). And indeed, as he navigates the turbid waters of the river, having entered its "wombe" (66), all of this discarded epic material flows back to the poet, encroaching and soiling the setting, the adventure, and its characters. In a mode that is "increasingly phantasmagoric and allegorical" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 261], and which parades an increasing accumulation of "_Centaures_," "_Gorgons_," and a "_Harpyes_" (68-69), epic repossesses the epigram, like "The slie _Ulysses_ [...] in a sheepes-skin" (113), thus debasing the system of exclusions and positive replacements that had compelled both the author and the reader to wager on its success.

##The return of the discarded II: a social and cultural indictment

###Religion and science

- Mercury - the name and the thing

- Atomic shit

- - -

###A commercial exchange

- __Is this my ending move?__

> If the symmetrical absence of a "saile," elliptical about the "tenuous analogy" between the two vessels, might be an ironical marker for the clumsiness of the whole comparison [@Duncan-Jones2005, 258], the subsequent substitutions present an undoubtable increase in intensity and number. The poem will feature "two [...] knaves" instead of one _Charon_, and both "more horride" than him. The idyllic _frogs_, which in Aristophanes' play accompanied Dyonisus' journey to Hades, will be replaced by the noisy emissions of "Arses," with a shift that adds smell to sound. Pure quantity motivates the exchange between "one _Cerberus_" and a hyperbolic "coast" of "dogs." Furthermore, the refusal of the _Furies_ in favor of the "scolds," linkable to the ideologically pervasive "process of commodity evaluation" [@Bruster1992, 16], overtly obeys to the principles of the marketplace. The _scolds_ are not superior to the _Furies_ in any specific attribute, nor are they more. Instead, working at the intersection between quantity and quality, we find a numerical correspondence between their worth - "each scold was ten."  Appraised on a decimal scale, _Furies_ and scolds function as the different coins of a single currency: we discard one and prefer the other because of their monetary value.

- __Falsity is the counterfeit; the new is the clothing.__



- __Falsity and superstition introduce the problem of religion; but not here.__

> Falsity and superstition seem to be the main reasons for the disposal of this cultural patrimony. Analogous to the inhabitants of another notoriously fabulous genre, chivalric romance, the "just knights" of these "tales" are condemned because of their lack of "power," to which the poet means to oppose a true "act." As it has been observed, this allegedly true narrative produces "an impression of realism and inclusiveness" through its "pervasive topicality" [@Medine1975, 98]. The stark contrast between the third person of the first four lines ("they") and the first person of the fifth ("We"), together with the naming of two protagonists, "_Shelton_" and "_Heyden_", probably known only to "those readers who had drunk regularly with them at the Mermaid tavern" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 259], aim at proving the authenticity of the story. Antiquity "brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer" (20): the poem is purged from the fallacious beliefs of the past, and pervaded by witnessed everyday experience.


The literary dispute between old fables and new adventures is thus transformed into a commercial exchange, based on quantity and measurable worth. This monetization must have resonated with Ben Jonson's constant concerns about the "unprecedented importance [_of_] coins," and about the problematic "correspondence between an object and its [monetary] value" [@Burlison2010, 285] - especially at the time of completing his collection of epigrams. Before its definitive publication in the _Works_ of 1616, the series was "licensed for issue in 1612 as a self-contained volume" [@Miles1990, 170], a project which was never concretized. Nevertheless, the expectation of a published product must have been troubling for Jonson, who was probably still wavering between his affection for "the notion of coterie poetry and manuscript circulation" and the inevitable "lure of print" [@Donaldson2000, 123]. His poems, which he considered "more important than anything he had written for performance" [@Miles1990, 169], would leave the privileged space of literary circles to become another of the many "consumer goods that could never be deemed essential for life" [@Thirsk1978, 78]. The negotiations that give shape to the microorganism of _The Famous Voyage_ mirror the major financial concerns surrounding the public circulation of his works and his identity.

After the purge and exchange of the _proemium_, the opening lines of the _The Voyage It Selfe_ indeed reiterate the correlation between the transactions that inform the poem and those that grant its marketability. Through a number of specific references to "authenticated exploits of the day" [most of them successfully identified by @Donaldson2011, pp. 32-34], the voyage is compared to those "wager journeys" that "had long since established [_themselves_] as a recognizable component of England's pervasive performance culture" [@Manous2009, 3] : expeditions to "_Venice_, _Paris_, [...] _Berwicke_" or "_Norwich_" (33-36). In these circumstances, wagerers would actually "put on moneyes" _against_ the chances of the traveler. As Manous explains, "If the journey was not completed and verified according to the terms of the wager, the traveler forfeited this sum; but if the journey was successfully completed and verified [...], the traveler was typically owed [...] a threefold to fivefold increase" [@Manous2009, 8-9]. Similarly, the poet seems to be prompting his readers, here asked twice to "listen well" (28, 40), to invest the "three for one" (28) of their attention on this literary journey, which will be completed according to the terms declared at the beginning - namely the exclusion of the false beliefs of classical literature in favor of an original and authenticated adventure.

- Conclusion: Ben Jonson is responsible for the decay of his cultural ecosystem, because he published - or because he wanted to publish - his epigrams, transforming his ideas into a book that has to be sold.

	- Isn't this conclusion still stupid?

##Introduction

- This could also be the right way of opening your __poem__ section.

> [__This could still be the right way of opening.__] The function of the classic references that permeate Ben Jonson's _Epigramme CXXXIII_ has seldom been debated. Discussed for its "massive length," for its distance from the "encomiastic and condemnatory" tone of the collection that it concludes, and for its "disgusting" content matter, the poem, [also known as] [__<---__ why aka?] _The Famous Voyage_, has nevertheless consistently been categorized as a "mock-heroic narrative"  [@Boehrer2002, 9].

- - -

In this "interweav[_ing_] of satire and saturnalia," occasionally "enlivened by carnivalesque humour" [@McRae1998], the names and the circumstances of Greek epic would simply be evoked with "great irony" [@Medine1975, 98], and to participate in a "parody of high poetic forms" [@Robinson2014, 566]. [__Avoid the quotations.__] These labels, however, have managed to obscure the way in which the poem first repudiates and then welcomes again the elements of epic, in a cycle that mirrors closely the corrupt ecosystem of the setting that it describes - the River Fleet.

- __The final epigram is an opening.__: The final poem in Jonson's collection of _Epigrammes_, completed before 1612 and published for the first time in the 1616 folio of WORKES, is both a closure and an opening. It opens the collection both stylistically and thematically: it constitutes a change in register, presenting a longer and distinct form, and a change in topic, moving from the limited perspective of the portraits and the occasional texts of the collection, to an urban exploration - a voyage. The hundred and two preceding epigrams are different: they isolate a person or an event as if it were presented outside time and space - an individual and its flaws or merits; the joy or grief experienced in association to an event; a city type. Types are a recurring preoccupation in these pages: the city types and the literary types. City types, such as Admiral Cod or Chavalier Shift, seem to anticipate or accompany the model of city observation frequently found in the plays: types that mirror the conventions of the English genre of city comedy or city play, being associated with specific social categories or classes of the period, while they remind the reader of the analogue Roman or Greek model of the Old Comedy, or of the contemporary Commedia dell'Arte staged in Italy. The Epigrams are in fact a laboratory for these models, a repertoire of postures, costumes, faces and situations that can be used, or expanded, in dramatic depictions of the city.

- But these types, as we have said, occupy a non-narrative space in the book. They are found in the city, and then portrayed as specimens in a collection of pictures. The book is not narrative; it is suspended in a dimension of moralistic contemplation; it is exemplary and almost abstract. The _Voyage_, epigram CXXXIII is therefore different for the way in which it opens the narrative to a different genre and to a different style - it is a journey out of the boundaries defined by the collection, in a specific time and in a specific place. It is a journey, then, and a narrative one; and it is striking because it occupies a new space.

- __The final epigram is NOT a mock-heroic epic.__

- __Definition of ecosystem__.

Narrative, in fact, requires a specific time and a specific space. The time is now; the space is the Fleet.

- - -

The true protagonist of _The Famous Voyage_, as we soon discover, is its very specific urban setting: the Fleet Ditch and its nearest surroundings. Although the first London toponyms appear quite late in the poem, as a double reference to the "_Bread-streets_ Mermaid" (l. 37) in Cheapside, where the journey begins, and to "_Hol'borne_" (l. 38), where it will suppodsedly end, a pronominal allusion to the Fleet is incorporated immediately after the introduction of "_Shelton_" and "_Heyden_" (l. 5), the main human presences in the narrative. If the two fellows are equated to renowned warriors of Homeric, Ovidian, and Virgilian tradition, the Fleet constitutes the "one" setting where all that the same tradition has boasted about the four infernal rivers - "_Styx_, [...] _Acheron_, | _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_" - is "prov'd" authentic (l. 7-8). The city stream becomes the pivotal character of this triad of actors, the "one" element which can provide the other two with a chance of surpassing the canon of antiquity: the necessary complement used to establish the magnitude of the adventure, and the valour of its heroes, is a genuinely hellish environment.

And the Fleet was undoubtedly hellish. By the time in which John Stow was writing his nostalgic _Survey of London_, published in 1598, the stream was no longer the broad and efficient waterway of yore, capable, as he recollects, of carrying "ten or twelve ship navies at once" [@Stow 44]. The Fleet had instead become the narrow ditch full of "filth, stench, noyse" which _The Famous Voyage_ describes (l. 9): a nauseatingly infamous landmark in Early Modern London, and a worrying indicator of the increasing environmental degradation caused by the unprecedented residential and commercial expansion of the period. It was not an isolated case: Ben Jonson himself used to live next to a very similar open sewer, a large artificial waste drain, when he was a boy, in Christopher Lane; according to Ian @Donaldson2011, the unforgettable olfactory and visual impressions associated to that overflowing stream of liquid garbage, registered as a child, later constituted the imaginative core of the scatological _Voyage_ (103). But there was something particularly admonitory about the Fleet, which Jonson attentively thematizes in his poem: an exemplary continuity between trade and pollution, generated by a mismanagement of waste.

Like the insalubrious canal running in the middle of Christopher Lane, the Fleet was a site of waste disposal; but, unlike the heterogeneous "effluent of all kinds" [@Donaldson2011 103] collected by the artificial sewer of Jonson's childhood, the contaminants found in the river had, in most cases, a definite origin. Quoting from a parliament record composed in the early XIV century, John Stow lists three historical reasons for its decay: the "filth of tanners and such others," the "raising of wharfs," which progressively narrowed the capacity of the waterway, and a "diversion" of its flow, produced to bring water to the mills of Baynard's Castle. The writer then explains how the latter two problems were supposedly tackled during the following decades, although the river "was never brought to the old depth and breadth" [@Stow 44]; but nothing is said about what happened to the "tanners and such others." In fact, despite the repeated attempts at cleansing the brook, accurately reported by Stow, these "such others" - workshops, kitchens, and their pollution - apparently never moved from the Fleet, thus causing the environmental degeneration described by Jonson's _Voyage_.

The contamination and waste produced by these shops was abundant and tenacious. John Stow ends his first description of the Fleet by lamenting how the "casting of soilage into the stream" had contributed to the brook becoming "worse cloyed and choken than ever it was before" [@Stow 45]. As Emily Cockayne recounts, the most resistant and toxic components of this thick "soilage" were probably those produced by the activity of slaughterhouses, tanners, dyers, butchers, cooks, and soap-makers, who manufactured and sold their products on the banks of the ditch. Together with a vast quantity of organic matter of animal origin, lively versified by Jonson as he describes how "The sinkes ran grease, and haire of meazled hogs, | The heads, houghs, entrailes, and the hides of dogs" (ll. 145-146), these trades also polluted the waters with "Whale, olive and rape oils," and with the byproducts resulting from "boiling together lime, ashes and fats" [@Cockayne2007 199-202]. Generating foul waste was an essential consequence for each of these processes: the craftsmen of the neighborhood manufactured their goods by separating what could be preserved from what had to be discarded; thrown in the river, the discards would then become an integral part of the ecosystem of the Fleet.

Although apparently anachronistic, the notion of "ecosystem" seems pertinent to understand the complexity of Jonson's treatment of the Fleet. Introduced in the 1930s, today the term is used to designate

> Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e., the community) in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e. exchange of materials between living and non-living parts) within the system. [@Gorham2011]

This definition relies on two interdependent ideas which, in _The Famous Voyage_, are consistently examined and questioned in relationship to the mismanagement of waste: "cycle" and "boundary." The interaction between these two concepts - the material, biological, and alimentary self-sufficiency of a _cycle_ and the relative porousness of the _boundaries_ enclosing it - informs an ecosystem. Like the Fleet and its surroundings, most of the ecosystems quoted in the rest of this definition revolve around a specific water supply, like "a wetland, a stream or lake, or - in the most logical case - a watershed within a sealed geological basin" [@Gorham2011]. The relative isolation that characterizes this last example is crucial for our purpose: the quintessential ecosystem, "the most logical case," is the one where the difference between the physical inputs and outputs entering or leaving the _cycle_ is minimized by a set of _boundaries_ that are almost impenetrable; in other words, one where matter is seldom truly discarded, and instead constantly reused. This is the case of waste in _The Famous Voyage_.

Jonson's poetical meditation on waste as the core of the degraded ecosystem of the Fleet implicitly alludes to two similitudes, that of the city as a human body and that of the city as a book, used by Early Modern writers to address the developing complexity of urban spaces, and of London in particular. We will for now focus on the first analogy, whose history was suggestively traced by Lawrence Manley as a specifically feminine trajectory, leading from a maternal or desirable body to an unfamiliar and monstruous one [@Manley1995]. The site which serves as the background of _The Famous Voyage_ relates, predictably, to the second category: Benedict Robinson, for instance, explains how the poem turns London into a "grotesque female body with the Ditch a filthy channel into it, [...] ambiguously mouth, vagina, and anus" [@Robinson2014, 569]. Leaving gender aside, this grotesque metamorphosis becomes even more relevant to the environmental degradation of the ditch and its waste if we consider that the portion of the brook explored by Jonson's adventurers had the special privilege - apparently unique at the time - of hosting "many a privie" (l. 73) on its banks: here human ejections would therefore be intentionally conveyed into the waters of the stream, to become part of its bounded material cycle [@Cockayne 200]. Waste corresponded to shit, both in a figurative and in a literal sense: if the metonymy transformed the city into a human body, then the Fleet inevitably became its excretory system.

But it is precisely as it establishes and expands on this correspondence that the imaginative organization of _The Famous Voyage_ most surprises the reader. As Andrew Mcrae has convincingly demonstrated, the leading motive of this exploration of the Fleet is its assimilation to "the alimentary canal, understood in Renaissance medical theory to be a single channel winding through the body, which received and digested food, and subsequently ejected food" [@McRae1998]. One of the most suggestive inventions of the poem, then, is that for which we follow the travelers along an unorthodox route, from anus to mouth, moving "haltingly through images of excretion to images of the preparation and consumption of food" [@McRae1998]. Summoned by this inversion, the first "ugly monster" (l. 61) of the narrative, encountered at the outlet of the Ditch, "_Bride-well_" (l. 42), functions as a Rabelaisian embodiment of the massive amount of excrement expelled through this "dire passage" (l. 59).

> In the first jawes appear'd that ugly monster,  
> Ycleped _Mud_, which, when their oares did once stirre,  
> Belch'd forth an ayre, as hot, as at the muster  
> Of all your night-tubs, when the carts doe cluster,  
> Who shall discharge first his merd-urinous load:  
> (ll. 61-65)  

The "load" that is here emitted (in the form of "an ayre") and discarded (as "merd-urinous") figuratively equates the collective waste produced by the entire population of London, to which the personal adjective "your" (l. 64) alludes: to appreciate its odor and heat, the public is asked to imagine a collection of night soil so copious as to cause a state of urban congestion, paralyizing the "carts" transporting its piles (probably not an uncommon sight in the Early Modern capital, as explained by @Cockayne2007, 183-187). Still navigating the watercourse, we then discover that this hyperbolical mass of ordure is, in most cases, intentionally induced by the inhabitants of the neighborhood, who are prompted to ingest "spirits, [...] pills, and [...] potions" (ll. 101-102) to purge their bodies, "in shitten sort" (l. 98), from the unhealthy meals that constitute their daily diet. So that finally, as we ascend the last portion of the alimentary canal, this same adulterated food eventually becomes the focus of the expedition. 

The section of the poem concerning the "hot cookes" of "_Fleet_-lane" (l. 144) in fact coincides with the discovery of the culinary habits practiced on the river, which are everything but salubrious. The incessant contamination of food on the ditch is in particular associated with two related problems: the ubiquitous presence of pestiferous particles in the area, registered by the poet in the lines immediately preceding these, and the alarming practices of recycling which are associated to the processing of meals. The first issue happens on an atomic level, involving invisible fragments of waste which, within the bounded environment, imbue every liquid and gaseous substance, and encrust every solid surface:

> Whether it languishing stucke upon the wall,  
> Or were precipitated down the jakes,  
> And, after, swom abroad in ample flakes,  
> Or, that it lay, heap'd like an usurers masse,  
> All was to them the same, they were to passe,  
> (ll. 136-140)

The adventurers of _The Famous Voyage_ inhale these particles through their nostrils, almost automatically, by leaving them "open, and un-armed" (l. 135): as @Cockayne2007 (212) reminds us, the aerial infectiousness associated to analogous "miasmas" was especially dreaded at the time. But by juxtaposing this permeating model of contagion with the preparation and consumption of food recounted in the rest of the section, the poet seems to suggest that the inhabitants of the area can absorb toxic substances in other ways: by consuming products that have been exposed to these fumes, for instance, or by cooking and eating animals that have fed on adulterated meat and water (again a common concern, as outlined by @Cockayne2007, 95-97). Besides, in addition to this microscopic and involuntary infection, the second issue reported by Jonson introduces a deliberate and macroscopic one, enclosing the alimentary cycle of the ecosystem within a disturbingly autotrophic boundary.

> Cats there lay divers had beene flead, and rosted,  
> And, after mouldie growne, againe were tosted,  
> Then, selling not, a dish was tane to mince 'hem,  
> But still, it seem'd, the ranknesse did convince 'hem.  
> For, here they were throwne in with'the melted pewter,  
> Yet drown'd they not. They had five lives in future.  
> (ll. 149-153)  

As we will see, the "five lives" which conclude this passage have a mythological connotation. From a purely material standpoint, however, the figure can also refer to the inexhaustible quality of this resilient nourishment: the text counts four explicit deaths (roasting, toasting, mincing, and either flaying or drowning), but we might easily predict how being "throwne" into the Fleet might provide the feline carcasses with endless opportunities to be consumed again and again, either "melted," like the alloy, with the infernal fluid of the ditch, or devoured - and excreted - by the animals bred or seized along its banks. Nothing is discarded from the bounded cycle of this ecosystem: the revelation of this scatological _Voyage_, awaiting both the adventurers and the readers who reach its end, is that the two extremities of its alimentary canal are shockingly adjacent. Although the thematic shift from excretion to consumption observed by McRae is still discernible, the purpose of the conclusion seems that of displaying the revolting continuity between sustenance and feces.

The specter of coprophagy haunts the final section of _The Famous Voyage_. It is a material and a cultural specter. As Mary Douglas explains in her anthropological meditation on _Purity and Danger_, public rituals involving the boundaries of human corporeality and its excretions manifest a symbolic equivalence between the organisms of discrete bodies and that of the society to which they belong [@Douglas1966, 114-128]. If individual anatomical margins correspond to shared social margins, then the biological discharges of a single physical person can symbolize the ideological discards of an entire community. Her notion of "social pollution" clarifies the meaning of collective taboos stating, for instance, that the matter "issuing from the body is never to be re-admitted," or articulating anxieties about the danger of "anything which has once emerged gaining re-entry" [@Douglas1966, 122-123]. These injunctions define the control that should be exerted over an open ecosystem, both somatic and mental: the cycle within it should differentiate between input and output, and then dispose of its intellectual and material waste. But the cycle of _The Famous Voyage_ is instead deleteriously obstructed and coprophagous; the boundaries of the body which it metonymically signifies, those of a monstrous London, are also threatened in their social and cultural regulation. To express this ideological decay, which is then extended to his responsabilities as a writer, Jonson introduces a second urban analogy: that of the city as a book.

The historical and literary identity of this similitude is more fragmented: we can find its principles in the correspondence between written and spatial units which models Stow's chorography [@Manley 158-167], or in the creative textualization of urban experiences inspiring pamphlets such as Dekker's _The Wonderfull yeare_ [@Twyning1998 8-10]; by adapting its rhetorical qualities and poetical choices to the urban landscape which it describes, _The Famous Voyage_ certainly suggests a similar equivalence. Nevertheless, the premises for this verbal reproduction of a concrete physical circumstance  - in this case the sealed ecosystem of the Fleet - are actually found in another notorious episode of disgust invented by Jonson himself: the "literal purge of bad language" [@Robinson2014 563] of _Poetaster_. Written around the summer of 1601, approximately eleven years before the completion of the _Epigrammes_, the comedy concludes its plot with an unusual pedagogical treatment. In the presence of Caesar and Virgil, Horace, the archetypal satirist, administers to Crispinus, the incompetent versifier of the title, a fistful of "somewhat bitter [...], but very wholesome" (ll. 396-397) pills. As soon as the medicine works its effect, the patient starts moaning loudly.

> __Crispinus__. [_Groaning_] O -  
> __Tibullus__. How now, Crispinus?  
> __Crispinus__. O, I am sick -  
> __Horace__. A basin, a basin, quickly; our physic works. [_To Crispinus_] Faint not, man.  
> [HORACE _holds a basin into which_ CRISPINUS _appears to vomit his words._]  
> __Crispinus__. O - _retrograde_ - _reciprocal_ - _incubus_.  
> __Caesar__. What's that Horace?  
> __Horace__. [_Looking in the basin_] _Retrograde_, _reciprocal_ and _incubus_ are come up.  
> (ll. 455-463)  

The comical effect of the scene is achieved through the assimilation of Latinate terms to weighty solid objects, in a conflation of cultural and material nourishment, pollution and illness that anticipates the tone of the scatological expedition through the Fleet. The eccentric vocabulary that has infected Crispinus (commonly identified as a parody of Marston's style, as in @Cain1995, 25-27) has to be expelled from his organism, like a poisonous meal, and replaced by the "strict and wholesome diet" (l. 524) of authoritative readings which Virgil later devises for him. The image of literature as food is canonical; the playwright's innovation is in the semantic richness, and graphic vehemence, with which the ingestion causes first intoxication, then constipation, and finally sickness. Indicated as a mass of "filth" (l. 484) clogging the _Poetaster_'s stomach, words have to be literally purged from his alimentary canal; in a similar fashion, then, Jonson opens _The Famous Voyage_ with a discharge of epic from the body of his poem.

Two editorial peculiarities characterize the opening of _The Famous Voyage_, indicating to the reader both the uniqueness of the poem against the rest of the collection and the aesthetic connotations of its first rhetorical gesture: the first is the presence of two distinct headings, one for the exordium (_On the Famous Voyage_) and one for the body of the text (_The Voyage Itself_); the other is the dense frequency and idiosyncratic use of italicized nouns. The consequence of the two headings is the creation of a differentiated liminal space, a textual boundary, where the poet can assert a separation between the actual organism of the composition (_Epigramme CXXXIII_ itself) and its surroundings, either those constituting the audience's memory of an analogue literary tradition, or those established by the physical volume containing the writer's works. The insistence on italics (in which Ben Jonson took particular care, as demonstrated by @Riddell2000, 156) is instead reminiscent of the literary cleansing of _Poetaster_: here too the typographical mark denotes terms that, like the abstruse idioms in Crispinus' speech, can acquire weight, and therefore be treated - or mistreated - like tangible objects operating within a physical environment. Both the double heading and the presence of italics, then, contribute to the enactment of another linguistic purge.

> __On the Famous Voyage__  
>   
> NO more let _Greece_ her bolder fables tell  
> Of _Hercules_, or _Theseus_ going to _hell_,  
> _Orpheus_, _Ulysses_: or the _Latine Muse_,  
> With tales of _Troyes_ just knights our faiths abuse:  
> We have a _Shelton_, and a _Heyden_ got,  
> Had power to act, what they to faine had not.  
> (1-6)  

By comparing the initial six lines of the proem with the bold declaration which begins the _The Voyage It Selfe_ - "I Sing" (l. 21) - the reader realizes that the function of the italic font is to mark terms for deletion, or - better - for ejection. With the exception of "_Shelton_" and "_Heyden_", the two champions of the adventure, these nouns, clasped by the double negation "NO" (l. 1) and "not" (l. 6), constitute a list of every element that the poet has resolved "not" to sing about, or "not" to include in the body of his composition. Although suggestive of an _occupatio_ - a denial to indulge in the narration of events that the same denial is in fact contradictorily relating - these allusions do not reveal anything about the characters and places which they mention: the referents are evoked for the sole purpose of being discarded, paralleling the paradoxical articulation of banned words which increased the comical effect of _Poetaster_'s emetic cure. In the detached space of the journey's exordium, this purge serves as the regulation of the formal boundary that encloses the textual ecosystem of _The Famous Voyage_: an expulsion which incorporates the proper names of classical heroes ("_Hercules_," "_Theseus_," "_Orpheus_," "_Ulysses_"), the mention of a single, unspecified "_Latine Muse_," and three toponyms ("_hell_," "_Greece_," and "_Troyes_"). The sum of these names implies the vast mass of literary matter ejected not only from the poem, but also from the book for which it was written.

Indeed, as the rear end of Jonson's _Epigrammes_ (which was licensed for an autonomus publication in 1612, as recorded in @Miles1990, 170), the proem to _The Famous Voyage_ doubles as the performance of a vaster expulsion, separating the contents of the book from any work that, for aesthetic reasons, could not be included in it. Even at the moment of its actual publication, in the folio containing the assorted _Workes_ of 1616, the collection assumed a liminal position, separating the plays from the compositions "of divers nature, | and matter congested" found in _The Forrest_ and _Under-woods_ (where we read this definition, in _To the Reader_, ll. 3-4). With very few exceptions, the _Epigrammes_ are instead homogenous in their realistic content, in most cases satirical or encomiastic, and in their recognizable form, typically short and witty. Understandably, then, the genre expelled in this exordium has to be their exact opposite. The country of "_Greece_" and the city of "_Troyes_," which open and close the sequence of discarded nouns, correspond to a cultural and literary synecdoche confirmed by each name on the list: that of the "bolder fables" of epic, fanciful and long-winded. By excluding the old, counterfeit forms which "our faiths abuse," the author is trying to conform to the formal requisites of his collection, and to purify the rhetorical ecosystem of the poem itself.

But, as we have seen, nothing can be truly discarded in the ecosystem of _The Famous Voyage_. Although in the first few lines of _The Voyage It Selfe_ the writer's vessel manages to steer away from the discarded waste of classical epic, initially restricting his intertextual allusions only to the romance of "King _Arthurs_ table" (l. 24), the load ejected in the exordium starts flowing back to the adventurers as soon as they approach the entrance to the ditch, "_Bride-well_" (l. 42). Here the poet suddenly realizes how "'tis od | That all this while [_he has_] forgot some _god_ | Or _goddesse_ to invoke" (45-46): addressed to Hercules, the invocation that then follows echoes elements of the introductory purge almost verbatim.

> _Alcides_, be thou succouring to my song.
> Thou hast seene _hell_ (some say) and know'st all nookes there,  
> Canst tell me best, how every _Furie_ lookes there,  
> And art a _god_, if _Fame_ thee not abuses,  
> Alwayes at hand, to aide the merry _Muses_.  
> (50-54)

Distinguished by the same typographic mark, the names of "_hell_" and of the "_Muses_" return into the body of the text, again signifying, through synecdoche and metonymy, the two sides of the rejected genre which the author had resolved to resist - a mythical, or fanciful, content (the "_hell_" visited by the demigod, as "some say"), and its expression through an old form (the one sung by the "_Muses_"). The two nouns are even connected to the same rhyming verbs, "tell" (here an internal rhyme) and "abuses" (here a third person singular, to match the plural name). Mirroring the environmental degradation of the Fleet, which, as we have seen, is here presented as alarmingly obstructed and coprophagous, the poem is thus ingesting the same matter that it had initially expelled. From this point until its conclusion, and especially after having entered the dark, turbid "wombe" (66) of the ditch, the _Voyage_ will parade an increasing accumulation of "_Centaures_," "_Gorgons_," and "_Harpyes_" (68-69). Encroaching the setting, soiling the adventure and its characters, feeding discarded verses and expressions to the reader, epic, like "The slie _Ulysses_ [...] in a sheepes-skin" (113), repossesses _Epigramme CXXXIII_, and the collection to which it belongs.

1. The formal reproduction of the Fleet's bounded cycle, through the subtlety of this rhetorical gesture, is perhaps the most revolting feature of a poem that "many (perhaps most) readers have found [...] simply disgusting" [@Boehrer2002, 9]. As readmission follows expulsion, the reader eventually perceives how a perfectly sealed ecosystem, when its ability to regulate the ejection of waste is obstructed, becomes indistinguishable from its contrary - a completely porous one; a dysfunctional boundary, even when impenetrable, is equivalent to an absent boundary. In this circumstance the collective threat symbolically attached to the violation of bodily margins, and defined by Douglas as a form of "social pollution," reaches an extreme that we could instead identify with Julia Kristeva's notion of the "abject." As she theorizes in _The Powers of Horror_, the unexpected disintegration of the individual boundaries defining the self, experienced as a sudden sense of contiguity with "wastes" such as "body fluids, [...] defilement, [...] shit," eventually produces a fall from the order of language and society, into "the place where meaning collapses" [@Kristeva2002, 229-231]. This collapse is not extraneous to the material and cultural degradation of _The Famous Voyage_. In part, as we have seen, Jonson is expressing it through the physical

	- words acquiring weight; then, confusion introduced here.

2. Here, confusion. Hercules, perhaps. But then mercury and cultural recycling.

3. And then the rest.

> The four rivers of Hades converge into a single earthly waterway, constituting a numerical equivalence that would still motivate a consumer's preference for the contemporary adventure over the old epic. But this sum reveals a fault, introduced by the concessive phrase "save only": the rational, "subtl[_e_] distin[_ction_]" between the discrete elements of that written world of "Poets" is, in the reality witnessed by Jonson and his "adventurer[s]," turned into an unutterable jumble of "filth, stench, noyse." This quality returns in the compound "merd-urinous" (65), used to describe the inextricably mixed constituents of the waste polluting the river, and in the invocation to "_Alcides_" (50) that is disingenuously introduced by the poet after the beginning of his _Voyage_.

> The character behind this designation, Hercules, is a hybrid born of a human, Alcmene, and a god, Zeus. His origin is mixed, like the waters of the Fleet: this duality, underscored by the reference to Alcaeus, the human grandfather remembered in the patronymic, is then emphasized by the ambivalent way in which the poet refers to the frail humanity of his "backe, and bones [_,_] sore" from his "former labors" (55), while attributing to him an undisputable divinity.

1. The purge:

		- Also, the boundary is set between the poem and the collection to which it belongs.


		- The belief that I am regulating a functional boundary; a boundary that is open and efficient and will not re-absorb shit.


1. 
	- Is there that much to say about this? I fear that this section might actually count just two juicy paragraphs.


	- The second paragraph is about how the discharged matter flows back. The poem is _formally_ coprophagous.

	- Also, perhaps we should insist on the idea of _fixity_.

- Some matter to include here - perhaps:


Then let the former age, with this content her,
Shee brought the Poets forth, but ours th'adventurer.

Why is he using the italics for the poets?

The Voyage It Selfe
The title as a boundary. Explanations of its effectiveness have been insufficient so far.

We will of course focus on the idea of boundary elsewhere.
I sing the brave adventure of two wights,
And pitty 'tis, I cannot call them knights:

- This could still work as the end of section __2__.

> As a result, although the thematic shift from excrement to nourishment observed by McRae is undoubtable, the alimentary matter of the poem is indistinguishable from its fecal counterpart. A threatening uncertainty suffuses the "monstruous femininity" of this urban setting, evocative of a "grotesque female body with the Ditch a filthy channel into it, [...] ambiguously mouth, vagina, and anus" [@Robinson2014, 569]. The origin of this ambiguity might be related to what Julia Kristeva defined as "_abject_ [...], the jettisoned object" which, being "radically excluded [_,_] draws [_one_] towards the place where meaning collapses" [@Kristeva2002, 230]. This collapse in meaning, provoked by a sudden encounter with the "body fluids, [...] defilement, [...] shit" and "death" [@Kristeva2002, 231] of the Fleet, is equivalent to the "confus[_ion_] described by the poet of the _Famous Voyage_ in its _proemium_.

> All, that they boast of _Styx_, of _Acheron_,  
> _Cocytus_, _Phlegeton_, our have prov'd in one;  
> The filth, stench, noyse: save only what was there  
> Subtly distinguish'd, was confused here.  
> (7-10)

> The initial rejection is indeed followed by a fitting replacement for the discarded matter. In the following lines the poet asserts the superiority of his composition, both in quality and in quantity.

> Their wherry had no saile, too; ours had none:  
> And in it, two more horride knaves, then _Charon_.  
> Arses were heard to croake, in stead of frogs;  
> And for one _Cerberus_, the whole coast was dogs.  
> _Furies_ there wanted not: each scold was ten.  
> (11-14)


1. _The Famous Voyage_ is a revolting poem for many reasons; yet, we think that the corruption of its ecosystem, described in the mixture between output and input, between discarded and preserved, between ingested and expelled, is perhaps the most disgusting idea at the core of the poem. This is the moment when the threatening inversion described by Douglas, a cultural taboo in many of the culture which she analyzes, becomes equivalent to an even more destabilizing threat - one that pushes the self back into the pre-symbolic order in which boundaries are not only threatened, but cease to exist - the abjection described by Kristeva in _The Powers of Horror_. This transition is the most disturbing feature of _Famous Voyage_, and, as we will see the disappearance of boundaries is at the core of the final transition operated by the poet, from the material to the immaterial - and back.
	
	- Here we have __Douglas__: from _pollution_ to _impurity_.
	
	- The dissolution of boundaries is the dissolution of the self and its linguistic categories; these linguistic categories are again upturned in the final section of the poem.

	- The end of this section should transition from the violation of boundaries expressed in Douglas to the pure abjection theorized by Kristeva. This discovery is perhaps the most revolting idea contained in the poem; it is the perverse absorption of waste through air and - more strikingly - food.

	- More important consequences:

		- A loss of boundaries implies a loss of the distinctions made possible by boundaries; it indicates the fall into the symbolic order, the collapse of the entire ecosystem (cultural, economic, physiological); that means that we will no longer be able to distinguish what is new from what is old, what is authentic from what is counterfeit; what is material (science?) from what is immaterial (religion?); shit from food.
		
		- We should truly emphasize the role of coprophagy in this entire discourse. Is coprophagy a taboo? How is coprophagy related to language? How is the horror of coprophagy resonant with both the terror of pollution and impurity (Douglas) and the terror of the abjection (Kristeva)?

##3. The age (the city)

1. I would now like to focus on the second part of the poem, and on the way in which Ben Jonson specifically introduces two distinct figures that participate in defining not only an ecological indictment about the negative consequences of commercial thriving, but also a cultural indictment about the consequences of the commodification of culture, of which Jonson was becoming responsible right at the moment when he decided to collect his _Epigrammes_ with the purpose of publication. The two references that I would like to consider, therefore, are the one to __Mercurius__ in the section of the poem devoted to the collective purge of the inhabitants of the area, and that to Democrite and to Pythagoras in the final section of the poem. 

2. At the core of both these moments we find an analogous slippage: the one that seems, in the end, to justify the way in which abstract matter - the erudite references to the epic matter of Virgil and Homer - are turned into concrete waste that responds to the physical rules of expulsion and pollution. The idea is simple: metonymy creates a sort of vibrant weight, of oscillating weight, for which some of these referents can possess a definite value, bounded in time and space, and some others do not. _Mercury_ is perhaps the most evident example: when he is first mentioned, in the poem, we think that he is a divinity, another inconsistent invocation to a dead god disappeared with the supposed advancement of history and culture. But this is not the case - Ben Jonson is not exclusively referring to the deity, a name as inconsistent as the rest of the fictional characters that inhabit this poetical space; he is in fact referring to the homonymous metal, the _mercury_ whom _Paracelsus_ transformed into the appropriate element that ought to be used for the treatment of constipation. Mercurius is both; time has turned the name into a different item, into a commodity that can be ingested and expelled, and at the same time into its own memory. At the basis of Jonson's complaint about Mercury's debasement, then, is a problematic treatment of metonymy and personification: Mercury is both the god and the metal that can be used to treat constipation.

	- Note: there is more to be done about the cat, if we look at it closely: metempsychosis has become the act of a cat inhaling a human fart and therefore being able of speaking with a human voice; more, metempsychosis through shit elides the boundary between human and nonhuman, and the boundary between life and death.

###Religion and science

- Remember that:

	- this section is based on the exchange between _material_ and _immaterial_; and it can be linked to Kristeva's abjection as the last stage of Douglas' loss of definite boundaries, as the threat of a regression from the symbolic order.

3. Metonymy and personification here stand for two different viewpoints; for two different Zeitgeisten - the religious viewpoint that associated Mercury with the divine messenger and protector of pharmacy, and that which instead sees in the name only an element useful to produce pills which, again, force to body to expell its impurities. 

4. Similarly, in the final part of the poem, religious and scientific ideas mix again in order to create a confusing effect.

	- Be sure to include these ideas:

		- "Mercury" - the name (deity) and the thing (metal);

		- atomic shit.

	- And these ideas:

		- Democrite as the father of materialism; Pythagoras as the father of a metaphisical and esoterical tradition;
		
		- Materialism and spiritualism are at the core of this discourse (but the vagueness of this transition can be associated with the fall from the symbolic registered in Kristeva).

	- This section will be the true original content of this new version; therefore, we have to make sure that it is fully developed properly.

###A commercial exchange

1. Up to this point, then, Ben Jonson has linked three different ecosystems, real and metaphoric, in order to describe their related corruption: the Fleet Ditch, the poem, and the culture of the city. In each one of these ecosystems we have individuated a corruption based on the infiltration of waste into the regular cycle of production and consumption of food and commodities. As the distinction between discarded and preserved matter is threatened, the boundary that holds society and community and the environment together seems to dissolve, leading to an ideological confusion between material and immaterial, which we have associated with both the return of religion within a materialistic and scientific culture, and as a potential return into the realm of the pre-symbolic through the notion of _abjection_. But, we might ask, what are the specific conditions that lead to this point? What forces the cycle which sustains the ecosystem to its stress - to an intolerable stress? Our answer is commerce.

2. The activity of soap-makers, butchers and tanners is what causes the false discarding of raw matter into the river; as they are thrown into the stream, these materials encounter the blockage and the encroachments and the soilage of the flow, and are forced to return to the producer, or to soil the products and the consumers. Corruption seems to be an inherent part of the commercial cycle in the ecosystem of the Thames. But the same could be said about the other examples provided by Ben Jonson: Mercury is reduced to faecal matter and gas because it has been treated in order to be sold and consumed; it has become a commodity. The same could be said about the spirits floating around the bank and possessing the dead carcasses of the animals which have been flayed and treated for food; these are products, like the pies, that are specifically devised to be consumed by somebody different from the cooks. Commerce allows for the disgusting coprophagic food chain; for the reduction of Mercury to debased metal; for the notion of metempsychosis becoming the simple propagation of miasmas from one life form to the other. Broadly speaking, Ben Jonson seems to impute the decayed state of the ecosystems which he describes to the proliferation and thriving of commercial enterprises. By producing byproducts of animal origin, which are then ingested and consumed and absorbed by human and nonhuman animals alike, these activities cause the confusion and corruption of the ecosystems in which they are inserted; they actually produce it. In fact, we might even say that commercial enterprises in the world of the _Famous Voyage_ are both the cause of corrupt food chains, and the propagators of these very food chains - the actors, the makers of these very food chains. But this critique of commerce does not limit itself to the subject matter of the poem; it can, in fact, be extended to the poem itself and to the formal qualities which we have encountered so far.

	- The opening of the poem is __negation__ (false _occupatio_); by the end of it we have instead the return of the discarded (_pollution_, _contamination_, and so on); this is all allowed by the exchanges activated by commercial exchange; commercial exchange is the condition that renders the boundaries porous; commercial exchange works on the condition that the boundaries on which it operates are porous.

	- Epic _was_ the old stuff; now it is not any more. Religion _was_ the old stuff; now it is not any more; _epic_ and _religion_ used to be authentic (true beliefs); now they are equally associated to superstition.

	- In the end, then, as soon as a product - a cultural product - enters the market, we can no longer be certain of its durability as something worthy of praise.

3. We could in fact claim that the same _Famous Voyage_ is, in itself, a commercial transaction happening in front of our eyes.

> After the purge and exchange of the _proemium_, the opening lines of the _The Voyage It Selfe_ indeed reiterate the correlation between the transactions that inform the poem and those that grant its marketability. Through a number of specific references to "authenticated exploits of the day" [most of them successfully identified by @Donaldson2011, pp. 32-34], the voyage is compared to those "wager journeys" that "had long since established [_themselves_] as a recognizable component of England's pervasive performance culture" [@Manous2009, 3] : expeditions to "_Venice_, _Paris_, [...] _Berwicke_" or "_Norwich_" (33-36). In these circumstances, wagerers would actually "put on moneyes" _against_ the chances of the traveler. As Manous explains, "If the journey was not completed and verified according to the terms of the wager, the traveler forfeited this sum; but if the journey was successfully completed and verified [...], the traveler was typically owed [...] a threefold to fivefold increase" [@Manous2009, 8-9]. Similarly, the poet seems to be prompting his readers, here asked twice to "listen well" (28, 40), to invest the "three for one" (28) of their attention on this literary journey, which will be completed according to the terms declared at the beginning - namely the exclusion of the false beliefs of classical literature in favor of an original and authenticated adventure.

- - -

1. Let us have a closer look at how the exchange is described within the poem:

> If the symmetrical absence of a "saile," elliptical about the "tenuous analogy" between the two vessels, might be an ironical marker for the clumsiness of the whole comparison [@Duncan-Jones2005, 258], the subsequent substitutions present an undoubtable increase in intensity and number. The poem will feature "two [...] knaves" instead of one _Charon_, and both "more horride" than him. The idyllic _frogs_, which in Aristophanes' play accompanied Dyonisus' journey to Hades, will be replaced by the noisy emissions of "Arses," with a shift that adds smell to sound. Pure quantity motivates the exchange between "one _Cerberus_" and a hyperbolic "coast" of "dogs." Furthermore, the refusal of the _Furies_ in favor of the "scolds," linkable to the ideologically pervasive "process of commodity evaluation" [@Bruster1992, 16], overtly obeys to the principles of the marketplace. The _scolds_ are not superior to the _Furies_ in any specific attribute, nor are they more. Instead, working at the intersection between quantity and quality, we find a numerical correspondence between their worth - "each scold was ten."  Appraised on a decimal scale, _Furies_ and scolds function as the different coins of a single currency: we discard one and prefer the other because of their monetary value.

1. But, we might ask, if indeed the poem is describing commerce as the cause of the corruption of urban ecosystems, and if the poem itself is described as a commercial transaction - a wager - between the writer and the reader, founded on an exchange between epic and this form, what are the criteria that Jonson is using to prove the validity of his product? To find an answer, we will turn not only to the features described in the poem itself as being positive characteristics of the new product, but also to different spaces in which Ben Jonson describes consumeristic ideology and its consequences. In our prespective, there are two main criteria that would render a product commendable in the eyes of a customer: its being new (and not old) and its being authentic (and not counterfeit).
	
	- Think better about this transition. This is not the right way to proceed: you should explain that the poem is actually described a commercial transition _because_ Ben Jonson is using criteria that he has elsewhere associated with consumeristic ideology; and not vice versa. Use different works to explain why this one is about _buying_ and _selling_. Not the opposite.

	- The market __needs boundaries__: the authentic and the counterfeit; the old and the new. These boundaries distinguish what is preserved from what has to be discarded.

		- The market __needs boundaries__; but the market is also capable of __destroying__ them; of replacing them.

	- Boundaries are not a problem; the market is not a problem; the problem is the submission of cardinal boundaries to the erratic principles of the market; the problem is that, when I make the boundaries available for negotiation, evaluation, and _fashion_, I lose track of the very essence of the culture in which I live (the very cultural structure; the very cultural scaffolding).

2. In his 1599 play _Every Man out of his Humour_, the character of Fastidious Brisk ---

3. In his _Entertainment at Britain's Burse_, written in 1609, commodities are distributing according to ---

	- Falsity and the counterfeit are related to the problem of religion and faith.

##2. The poem (the purge)

1. The second privileged metaphor used to describe London in the literary works of the time, and the second metaphor that Ben Jonson uses to describe the Fleet and the culture and society which produced its corruption, is that of the city as a book. There are two ways in which this idea seems to be suggested in the text: one is extratextual, linked to the editorial practices usually attributed to Ben Jonson, and the second is textual, linked to the specific literary operation that Ben Jonson performs in his work.

	- The city as a book; the book as a corrupt ecosystem.

	- The form of the poem mirrors its theme.

###The Epigrammes and editorial practices

1. The Epigrams occupy the - - -

	- The epigrammes within the folio, and the Voyage within the epigrams. What is the meaning of these choices? How do they define margins? How do they mirror practices of discarding and delimiting boundaries?

	- The job of Ben Jonson as that of a tanner / butcher / soap maker.



- - -

> The poet has established an exchange based on the acquisition of what is allegedly both new and true, consistently with the principles "of a [growing] consumer society" [@Thirsk1978, 106], and enabled by the discarding of an old, fallacious tradition, signified by the disposal of the synecdochical referents in the _proemium_. As we have seen, Jonson had already compared similar processes of literary selection to a "purge": the fragments of epic and superstition that have been repudiated have thus become excrements, left behind by the sailless wherry of this poetical _Famous Journey_.

> Falsity and superstition seem to be the main reasons for the disposal of this cultural patrimony. Analogous to the inhabitants of another notoriously fabulous genre, chivalric romance, the "just knights" of these "tales" are condemned because of their lack of "power," to which the poet means to oppose a true "act." As it has been observed, this allegedly true narrative produces "an impression of realism and inclusiveness" through its "pervasive topicality" [@Medine1975, 98]. The stark contrast between the third person of the first four lines ("they") and the first person of the fifth ("We"), together with the naming of two protagonists, "_Shelton_" and "_Heyden_", probably known only to "those readers who had drunk regularly with them at the Mermaid tavern" [@Duncan-Jones2005, 259], aim at proving the authenticity of the story. Antiquity "brought the _Poets_ forth, but ours th'adventurer" (20): the poem is purged from the fallacious beliefs of the past, and pervaded by witnessed everyday experience.

> The literary dispute between old fables and new adventures is thus transformed into a commercial exchange, based on quantity and measurable worth. This monetization must have resonated with Ben Jonson's constant concerns about the "unprecedented importance [_of_] coins," and about the problematic "correspondence between an object and its [monetary] value" [@Burlison2010, 285] - especially at the time of completing his collection of epigrams. Before its definitive publication in the _Works_ of 1616, the series was "licensed for issue in 1612 as a self-contained volume" [@Miles1990, 170], a project which was never concretized. Nevertheless, the expectation of a published product must have been troubling for Jonson, who was probably still wavering between his affection for "the notion of coterie poetry and manuscript circulation" and the inevitable "lure of print" [@Donaldson2000, 123]. His poems, which he considered "more important than anything he had written for performance" [@Miles1990, 169], would leave the privileged space of literary circles to become another of the many "consumer goods that could never be deemed essential for life" [@Thirsk1978, 78]. The negotiations that give shape to the microorganism of _The Famous Voyage_ mirror the major financial concerns surrounding the public circulation of his works and his identity.

- Do not forget:

	- _here we need Bruster_: we need to work on him, to expand our understanding of him and so on;

		- Bruster talks about "the process of commodity evaluation" - the process of commodity evaluation has become crucial for your work;

	- the __famous__ voyage - why this adjective? It would be useful to emphasize how, in the end, the poem is a reflection on a literary practice.

##Conclusion

###Contrition and confession

1. Ben Jonson decides to publish the epigrams. Epigram CXXXIII is his envoi - he is letting the epigrams go, he is allowing them to flow freely into the commercial ecosystem of the city. But this, he knows it well, will cause problems.
	
	- Conclusion: Ben Jonson is responsible for the decay of his cultural ecosystem, because he published - or because he wanted to publish - his epigrams, transforming his ideas into a book that has to be sold.

	- An act of repentance: an apology (_apologia_) for entering this arena; since entering it means debasing your own work - participating in the same sort of perverse ecosystem that your poem describes.

		- Could this conclusion still be stupid?

			- It will be if you don't properly link it to every single premise; the fact that he is associating this move - his decision to publish the poems - with the commodification of culture; the fact that the commodification of culture is responsible for the broken exchange that is at the basis of the _Famous Voyage_; the fact that this commodification of culture produces the violation of boundaries that corrupts the entire social and intellectual ecosystem.

	- The problem is, simply, that the book has to become an object; that the book is nothing but an object. Turning the material into the immaterial is equivalent to turning shit into food.

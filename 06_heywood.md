I am thinking about the contrast between the outdoor scenes of the second act and the indoor scenes of the first.

Streets of London - Ending of the play;

Open countryfield in France - beginning of the play.

Something uncanny about the appearance of the king in that scene in the jewelry. I believe that that is the crucial moment that we have to devote our attention to. Since. What is a disguise. Why is this entire obseession with disguising and refurbishing and recycling a view of what the very city do

Economy of undesirable objects

failure of expulsion in the end. That's why she becomes a gh-gho-ghost!

#Stylistic Fl√¢nerie
The genre of _The Wonderfull yeare. 1603._ changes constantly: the treatise's title, preface and opening pages seem to belong to a historical chronicle, culminating in the proclamation of King James; the inception and the spread of the plague , on the other hand, refer to the tradition of the _memento mori_, directly addressing the readers and appealing to their imagination and empathy. As the horror increases, the author shifts to a pure allegory of death and its powers, represented as an army set to punish the vices of a materialistic society. Finally, the last section presents the most surprising twist, as the book becomes a sort of paradoxically pestilent _Decameron_, a collection of tales set not in the idyllic countryside where Boccaccio's teenagers found protection from the disease, but within the very walls of the dying city. Moreover, the first part of the work advances like a _prosimetrum_, honoring the treatment of its apparently higher matter through the interweaving of prose, epigrams and songs. On a smaller scale, Dekker's imagery possesses a similarly protean quality: the Queen's sickness, for instance, is first _a storme_ perturbing the Arcadian setting of the year's immaculate spring, then the "Element [...] scowl[_ing_] on the earth, and filling her hie forehead full of blacke wrinckles," then the "pale, meagry, weake child" nursed by _Death_, and finally the almost angelic "Courtier" summoning the sovereign into "the Star-chamber of heaven." Although its structure is clearer and more consistent, _The Guls Horne-booke_ is not exempt from these argumentative and rhetorical _anacolutha_: singing "unmusically" (as stated in the introduction), the author juxtaposes and accumulates images and thoughts drawn from the most diverse fields. Could we connect these unexpected mental and formal transitions, to which the author wilfully abandons himself, to the experience of wandering through the city?

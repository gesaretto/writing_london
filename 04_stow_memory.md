#Nostalgia in print

As Manley reminds us in his chapter on histories and topographies, John Stow "was more than sixty years old when he began his work on the city in which he had been born and raised" (163). The Londoner had spent decades collecting sources for his monumental "Survey": although in the introduction to her edition Antonia Fraser does not provide us with an explicit estimate of the number of volumes which he owned, it is clear that Stow took a special pleasure in finding, purchasing and constantly going back to "a great sort of old books printed" (13). From her generous portrait we get the impression that the man was a bibliophile before being an intellectual, a passionate reader before being a compiler; like his edition of Chaucer, his work on London seems to be the culmination of a spontaneous interest in the subject matter, as if the need for a new book had been caused by his perusal of many "old" ones - and not the contrary. Nevertheless, as Manley again points out, Stow's editorial work on his own city is far from exclusively bookish: as the description shifts from the settling of streams, walls, bridges, and towers, to their actual exploration, in the second section, this architectural syntax becomes the way of organizing not only the many episodes and pieces of history gathered from his sources, but also those sixty years spent within it. The wards of London become the headings, paragraphs and chapters of the author's _book of memory_, a volume where Stow finds inscribed, along with the written life of his nation, his own past. Could we compare Stow's nostalgic topography to the "great cosmographies and atlases" that, in Manley's words, were "plott[_ing_] and contain[_ing_]" the world through "the psychogeometric apparatus of print" (135)?

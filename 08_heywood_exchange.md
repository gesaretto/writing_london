#Metamorphic Stage

Thomas Heywood's treatment of the perimeter of the stage is consistently creative. His stage directions shape choreographies and hierarchies that either mimic the speeches and implications of specific scenes, or expose underlying tensions which are sustained through entire plots. Towards the conclusion of _The Faire Maide of the Exchange_, Master Flower and his wife simultaneously get a letter from each of their daughter's suitors, so that the husband enters "_at one doore reading a letter from Ferdinand,_ [while] _at the other_ [enters] _Mistris Flower, with a letter from Anthony._" As they keep reading autonomously, the two walk towards each other, until they meet, supposedly at the center of the stage: there "_Flower smiles reading the Letter,_ [and] _they snatch the letter from each other._" The scene visually summarizes its content, while foreshadowing what will happen: Ferdinand and Anthony are seemingly interchangeable; Phillis' parents are resolved to control their daughter's future; however, though self-centered, they are both potentially gullible. At times the actions implied by these laconic directions become too convoluted for the printed page: it is the case of the threefold "courting" of Phillis by the three brothers, a section dense with contrasting gestures, viewpoints, and talks "_in private_." Moreover, Heywood seems extremely conscious of the way in which the stage can constantly transform under the eyes of the audience: within the fiction of _If you know not me, you know nobody_, Hobson similarly enters his own shop, the misty streets of Deptford, and the bedroom of a French "_Curtezan_." Nevertheless, it is between these transitions that the most telling metamorphosis occurs: the "middle round and farre space" of the stage becomes the "open" courtyard of the Royal Exchange, occasionally exposed to "Summers heat, as well as winters colde." Is Heywood's theater as porous as this new arena?
